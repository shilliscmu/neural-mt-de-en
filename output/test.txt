and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we &apos;re going through initiation rituals .
we need to deal with the instructive separation through death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dancing and produce art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique amount of song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .

just knowing that jaguar shamen still traveling beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the myths of the elders of inuit are full of importance , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist still exist
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we &apos;re going through initiation rituals .
we need to deal with the instructive separation through death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dancing and produce art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique amount of song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the pena in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolythics in haiti , or the warriors in the carbon desert of northern kenya , the curanary in the mi
all these people teach us that there are other existences , other thinking , other ways to orientation on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only feel with hope .
together , the number of cultures in the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life , which earth is as important as the biological lifestyle that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural life as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be produced as the total of all the thoughts and dreams , myth ideas , which have been produced by the human imagination si
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of what we are , and what we &apos;re as an astonishing species .
and just like the biosphere happened , this happened to the ethnosphere -- just with even larger speed .
not a biologist , for example , suggesting that 50 percent or more of all species are just before dying , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenario in the field of bio
and the critical indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
when each one of them were born in this room , they were talked about 2,000 languages .
now a language is not just the entire of the vocabulary or a series of grammatic rules .
one language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture finds access to the material world .
each language is like an old-field forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , exactly half of them didn &apos;t walk into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught anymore . that means when nothing is going to be done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely to be one of the last of your people who speak your language , not to have an opportunity to pass the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope of children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually somebody elsewhere on earth , every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly and takes an elderly and takes the last silve of an old language with
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all just talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , le
let she be koge . &quot;
and then they would recognize what it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
and so today , i &apos;d like to take you in a trip through the ethnosphere , a short trip through the ethnosphere to try to understand what was actually lost .
now there &apos;s some of us who forget that if i say , &quot; different possibilities , &quot; really different possibilities of mine .
take this child of the baranan in the northwest of the amazona , the people of the anakonda , believe that they came out of mythologically from the east in the back of sacred snakes .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t cognitively differ between the colors of blue and green , because that &apos;s where people depend on the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language and a marriage process called linguistic exogamy : you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past . the strange thing about these great houses where six or seven languages will be talked about is that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
you just listen to and then you start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the warona in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , which was first contacted in 1958 peacefully .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to record and made a severely mistake .
they were throwing shiny photos from the air of what we would graduate as friendly gestures , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen some two-dimensional
they have these photographs from the forest floor , trying behind the face or the ficure , didn &apos;t found anything and conclusions that these are the five missionaries with the spear .
but the watarani not only killing outside with the spear .
they were turning each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by threats .
we followed the generation of eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people with pressure , they gave them that one of the people had become so old , and w
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps and determine what animal kind of animals were heard .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor harvard wondered whether i would be interested in going to haiti and infiltrate the secret societies , which were the foundati
to give a sense to give you a sense , of course , something about these remarkable beliefs in the voodo , and voodoo is not a culture of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the big world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism or whatever .
one continent is always left out , because the suggestion was that there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was an and voodo is just the result of these very deep reli
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and deaths .
the living birds are the spirits .
the minds can be contributed from under the great water , answers to the rhythm of dance , to generate the soul of the living , so that the acolyth is going to be god .
that &apos;s why the voodooesis like to say , &quot; your white goes into the church and talks about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take away from the mind . how can you get damage ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolythies in a trance construction that recognizes an amazing coal without combustion , an amazing implication of the ability to influence the body tha
well , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the cogi from sierra nevada de santa marta in north columbia , the most extraordinary things .
the old tyrannian civilization that goes up the caribbean coastal level of columbia , and in consequences of the education , this people got into an isolated volcanic massive that goes up across the
in a blood flucked continent , these people were the only things that have never been conquered by the spaning .
until today , it &apos;s governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education to the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shadowing world of the glacier , they did for 18 years . two periods of the pregnancy that they spe
and during this whole time , it &apos;s culturally introduced into the values of their society . values that their prayers are prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecol
at the end of this amazing initiation , one day you &apos;ll suddenly take one day in your life , at the age of 18 , you &apos;ll see a sun , and in this crystal consciousness of the first light tha
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition will be very important .
whenever we think of internal and landscape , we &apos;re either complaining rouseaud and the old quiet of the noble wild , which is a racial thought or on the other hand , and these people are conn
so inside , it &apos;s not being sentimental , not you &apos;re going to be weaken from nostalgia .
there &apos;s not a lot of place for that in the malarial winds of asta or the cold winds of tibet , but they &apos;ve still have shaped by time and rituals , the idea that the earth can only exist 
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andies that grows up in the belief that the mountain is an apu mind , who &apos;s going to determine a very different person , and have a different relationship
whether it &apos;s a spirit of a mind , or a bunch of earth , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to be rejected .
and that made me to another person when my friends are under the kitcuitus , who believe that these forests are living up and the cannibal spirits that live in the north of the world , gistors that 
well , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i just recorded last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahusaa , many of you have heard , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman .
what ayahusaa does so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preparation , but what &apos;s processing . on the one hand , there &apos;s two different sources , on the one han
this plant contains some very powerful tryptomines that are very similar to the serotonin , dimenthylopydmitemythylopy , which is very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanoma , how they scratch this stuff , this substance that you &apos;re making from different kinds of species as well , methochydimmethylycidemyth .
now this powder is something like being shot out of a gransformation , sadly from baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i &apos;ve actually got with my professor , richard evan shulles , the man who put the psychedelic erea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 3000s , and i said that you couldn 
but the thing about trypamines is that they can &apos;t be taken oral , because they &apos;re in the human gut named monoamin oxides , named monoamin oxides .
they can only be taken in connection with some other chemicals that mao denature .
now the fascinating thing is that the betabarolines that are in lians , mao minitors of exactly the way that &apos;s necessary to potentiate the tryptamines . so ask themselves .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of addresting plants are finding these two morphologically related plants , which , if that combines , create a kind of biochemical version so tha
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistakes , which turns out to be meaningless .
but ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 variations of ayahusaa that you &apos;re all going to recognize the great distance in the forest that appear to our eyes as one way .
and then you ask them how they studied their taxonomics , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand some of the plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you &apos;re taking each of the 17 variations at full of them , and they sing them to one in a different deal .
well , that doesn &apos;t get you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stamina .
well , the problem of the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult position of the injections that they &apos;re an orginill and color , but it &apos;s kind of limited to
so the fact is that in 300 years , you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century or technological innovation , but rather than an era that we were accepted and the massive destruction of biolo
all the cultures have been involved in the dance with new lifes .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t hear less to sioux when they took bows and arrows than the americans stopped being americans when they tasked horses and horses .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the ethnosphere . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the learning .
and wherever you look around in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures aren &apos;t written to the disease , these are dynamically living peoples whose existence will be polluted with
or when we go to the mountains of tibet , where i recently , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people is generally convicted , but the ethnosic , the destruction of the lives of people , not only won &apos;t be convicted , but generally and
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering tibets , if they didn &apos;t experience it on the bottom level .
i traveled with a young colleague , 6,000 miles from chenchua in westernchina southeast tibet to leasa , and only when i went to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear . 6,00
and the father of this young man was identified as the people of lama .
that meant that he &apos;s been taken during the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle flew their holiness with their diaspora that brought people to nepall .
his mother was locked up as punishment -- for the crime for criming .
he was smuggled into jail at the age of two years to hide under her rock spice , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister , who was actually going this taper , was brought into an education camp .
one day , she stood out of an armband mazo , and for that overlap , she had to go into a heavy work camp for seven years .
the suffering can be unbearable , but the suffering spirit of people is something that &apos;s informed .
and at the end of the end , we &apos;re really going to be in front of a choice . what do we want to live in a monotory world of monoto , or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that while we &apos;re moving towards a flath , designed , generic world , we not only see the entire range
and it &apos;s humbling about thinking that our species exists for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought us the agriculture , and us this moment the cult of the satcorn , the poetry of the shaman replaced through the prost of the priesthood and hierarchy , speciali
the modern industrial world as we know it is about 300 years old .
now , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re standing towards the coming millennia .
if we ask these countless world cultures after the meaning of human , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we &apos;re going to rediscover the opportunity to be what we are : people with full consciousness that all people and gardens can travel a space , and there are great moments of op
here &apos;s a photograph that i received at the northern end of the baffin islands when i went to the narwhaw hall , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful history of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the 50000 years at the establishment of our regime , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family that was afraid of his life , took all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the flights of their sweets were originally from fish that was emerged in karibi skin .
the grandfather of the man didn &apos;t fear the arctic night or the grandfather in front of the man .
he was going outside , he had his pans out of sea sea , and defected in his hand , and when the feces started , he formed them into the form of a knife .
he started speaking on the sides of the feces knife , and when it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he had the dog and improvised a dish , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvising a sledent , excended a different dog , and disappeared across the ice shools with the facel keature on the belt 
that &apos;s how you can do something from nothing .
and this is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and everything in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april in 1999 , the complete control over an aril that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nowature .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all minerals .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can be looking for and achieve .
and ultimately , i think , it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to these distant goals of the earth to recognize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the home countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that &apos;s going back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are part of our own children part of the hope .
what we &apos;re trying at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics can &apos;t be convincing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytel
165 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re busing a series of travels into the ethnosphere where we take our audiences to places of such cultural wonders that they can find one after another , and hopefully , you &apos;ll fin
thank you .
what i first first do is show you as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year ago , which is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environmen
we &apos;re looking at many , many gigabets of the digital photographs that you &apos;re continuously and continuously getting out to rearrange in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one is , for example , a scan of the congress library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixes .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the power of a system can restrict is the number of pixels on their screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , an example of non-sign data .
this is bleek house of dickens . every color is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text , and not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the text and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e- book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper experience or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular expect of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we &apos;ve added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really reaches these ideas to create these limitations for the available space on the screen .
we hope that that means no more pop-up and other meanings -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all streets in the u.s. .
over on the top of nasa &apos;s images .
let &apos;s get something else .
that &apos;s now even live on the internet . you can tell it .
this is a project with the name photosynth , which really connects two different technologies .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research about computer vision , who &apos;s university of washington , an university of washington , underneath the steve seat at the u.k.
and rick stellisci of microsoft research has been done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through pictures and make this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial order of the imagery here is actually meaning .
the computer vision algorithms have started these images so that they were made the real space in which these recordings were made near the grassic lake in the canadian rockies , and they &apos;re s
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are those that are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth where we first worked in the summer to show them what i think is really the point
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notrel dame who was only in the computer with pictures of flickr , just give you nothern lade in flickr , and you &apos;ll get images of men in t-shirts and
so these are all flickr pictures , and they &apos;re all standing in this way of relationships to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed i was going to work on microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the receiver here .
and i guess you can see that these are many different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the cell phone camera to professional slrss , a pretty large number of them that have been together in t
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange .
many of you are covered by faces , and so on .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame who was really recorded .
we can change the poster into a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and they &apos;re going to collect data from all -- from the entire collective storage of how visual the earth looks -- and everythin
all these photographs are connected , and it creates something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
look at this as the continuity of stephen wallers on virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that people use it , growing and their users for the users with the user with the application .
their own photographs are described with metadatas , which has given another person .
when someone has done and described all these sacreds and describes all these sacreds and demonstrates who they are all , my photograph from the notre dame cathedral suddenly becomes all this data ,
and of course , side products all of these are the immensive virtual models of earth , which were not only received by survices or satellite images and so forth , but through collective memory .
thank you .
i do i understand them right ? do i understand them right ? her software allows you to be a certain point within the next few years , all the images that are used by somebody in the world , basicall
yeah . it doesn &apos;t matter than discoveries .
if you want them to create hyperlinks between the images .
and she &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the full of the semantic information that many of these images have .
how if you do a weapon for pictures where they enter sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image is .
but what if the image links you with all their pictures ?
and then the scale of the semantic connection and the full that gives out of it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . hearly happiness .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some of the things from my book that i hope in the understanding of other things you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if they didn &
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all the western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this , if our goal is maximizing the community of our citizens , this is actually going through maximizing the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaningful , an impressive assumption for the human .
when people have freedom , each of us are for themselves to do the things that maximize our common , and nobody has to decide for us .
maximizing freedom to maximize choice .
the more choices have people , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom you have , the more freedom you have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that there wouldn &apos;t be anything in the sense to question it .
and it &apos;s also rooted deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . not a big one .
i just want to say a little bit about salatressing .
there &apos;s 175 dessings in my supermarket , when you don &apos;t count the 10 different olive oilens and 12 balassiomics that you could buy to make a large number of your own salate designs , whe
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
and then you go back to the consumer electronic business to put a stereo statement -- speakers , cd players , a cassette player , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
we can place 6.5 million different stereos from the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communications .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every telephone that you wanted to have , as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t bought it .
a consequence of what was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we &apos;ve got almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of the mobile phone .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp3 player , nase hair trimes and crime brulle facel .
and shouldn &apos;t you see this yet in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to run into the business and ask that question .
now you know what the answer to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are much more important than buying objects , the same explosion of choices are .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them : we could make , or we could do it .
has these benefits and risks .
has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , is these benefits and risks , and it has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not them . &quot;
the result is -- we call it patients autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift of the responsibility for the meetings of someone &apos;s responsibility for the decision of
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , that , if you think about it , no sense doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why are they asking about us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is you expect to call the doctor on the next morning and ask a change in prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like showing this slide .
we don &apos;t have an identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re inventing as often as we want .
that means that every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the standard assumption was that almost every one had and they could get married so fast as they could , and then get kids so fast as they co
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
today , everything is easy .
i teach them wonderful intelligent students , and i give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry now ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or should i make careers ? &quot;
they &apos;re all incredible questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions independently whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to show you and don &apos;t get good grades in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important answering questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , like carl designed , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every single day of every place on the planet -- to the randol hotel .
there &apos;s one corner that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody where the wirlesslan works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work to make decisions again and again and again if we should be working or not .
we can play our children in the football , and we have our cell phone on the one hip , and our blackberry on other hips , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned on , every minute where we &apos;re going to ask our children when we make a football game , we should be wondering , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s sure your experience of the football game is very different than it had been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we look like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good at this , so i &apos;m going to know what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxically , is that it &apos;s paralyzing .
with so many options that you can choose , it &apos;s very difficult to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of that , a study about investments in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investing acts of vanguard , the giant fond society of about a million collaborators and about 2,000 different works .
and what she found was per 10 investment ponds that the employer would take away for two percent .
they offer 50 investments -- 10 percent less employees take part of them than if it would offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment foods that are to the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you &apos;re supposed to choose to choose in tomorrow .
and then morning , and then morning , and tomorrow , and morning , and morning , of course never comes .
understand that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go into the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to return , it also means the decision makes so har
through the not participations , they give up to 5,000 dollars a year from the employer who would have been happy to reproduce your contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world looks like this .
you really want the decision to really meet when it &apos;s for everybody , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong salad ressing .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome paralysis and meet a decision , we end up with the outcome of the choice than if we had the possibility of deciding we
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is considered by the great selection of different salad resings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , what salad tressing is already perfect , and what happens is that t
the more opportunities there are , the more opportunity is nothing to regret , that &apos;s disappointing for the choice that you meet .
secondly , what economists call operating costs .
dan gilbert did this morning by telling how much the way we rate things , from depending on what we compare it .
all right , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives , it &apos;s just to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that you &apos;re exclusive , that makes you less satisfied with the alternative
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i &apos;m sorry .
but here is what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hampton .
very expensive .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my manhated neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the opportunity to have day over day to have a great parking lot .
operatunity costs down the happiness that we get through our selection , even though what we &apos;ve looked at fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are the choice , the more attractive properties of that selection are considered in the operating cost .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon does some statements .
he &apos;s doing a statement about living now , and maybe to do things slowly about things .
but an important point he &apos;s doing is , whenever you decide for one thing , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less appropriate .
third , escalation of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was one time where there were jeans of some kind , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they were washing enough , they started to feel &q
so , to buy new yeans , after many years of the words of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want to be blank , lightly closent or far ?
do you want to have buttons or reliable ? stone or ocean acid ?
do you want to have jeans with holes ?
they want to cut at the bottom , raily , blah blah , blah ... &quot; and so he told her .
my jaw was down and after recovering myself , &quot; i would like to have the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour to try and try and try these damn jeans , and very the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best fitting jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had it better . all this choice allowed me to have me better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain myself .
the reason i felt worse , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations than they got in a species .
when they came in 100 species , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was expecting , and what i had was disappointing in comparison to what i expected .
and that increases possibilities in the lives of people increasingly increasingly expectations have increased about how well these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because , if they were , you wouldn &apos;t know what they &apos;re going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason which was all better than anything worse than anything was worse than everything was worse , was possible for people who were a comfortable surprise .
nowadays , in which we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best you can hope is that things are as good as you &apos;re expecting it to you .
they &apos;ll never surprise because their expectations , my expectations , are home .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they all come from -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have better . i didn &apos;t leave me .
but leaving is not always a bad thing .
eventually , a consequence of buying a bad sitting jean when there &apos;s one way to buy , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is responsible . the world is responsible . what coul
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the woodest , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of the choices are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only but a significant contributors to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people experience the disappointing because their standards are so h
and so the bilance result is that we &apos;re generally better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remember them .
this is the official dogma that we all keep for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that something &apos;s better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow , the more choice is better than something .
there &apos;s a magic lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point on the selection of improving our common good .
now , as an essential question -- i &apos;m almost done -- i &apos;m almost done -- asking questions about what &apos;s all about thinking about , which enables all this choice in the industrialized
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you , their problem is not the great choice .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a pretty problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating , and steve levit has tell you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to help them installing car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help .
they actually do .
you &apos;re worrying for what we &apos;re going to stand .
when something that people &apos;s people in our society allows to make decisions in which people would have too little choices , not just improves the lives of people , but our would be improved .
economists call this a pare-improvement advertising .
income distribution is going to worry about all the better -- not just the poor , because all of this great choice is going to do .
and finally , read this cartoon , and , a developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold fish glass . &quot;
fuzzy phantage , a short-term view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came up with the view that the fish is something .
because the truth is , if you break the gold fish glass so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the gold fish glass , so that everything is possible , remember happiness .
they increase the paralysis and drink happiness .
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
this is almost complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but that &apos;s about a metaphoric gold fish glass is a recipe for elevation , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we started by a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new lifes .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and that in different levels .
we have different approaches to simplify it until the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years , and when we sequenced the human genome , the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate life or whether we can create new lifes , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma getaium , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate himself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with an even smaller gen
we &apos;ve been able to distribute it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something like this .
but when we look at this metabolic map that &apos;s very simple , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &
so we decided that the only way to the front is to actually synthesize this chromosome that allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does the chemistry make these really large molecules what was never been done before ?
and if we can , we can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is , by the way , a piece of interest chemical material .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic codes has been very slowly developed , but our final point is going to put on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years with a biothetic review before we did the first experiments .
and as it turns out , dna synthesization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we put together these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , beginning with the digital information , the genome phi x 17 .
it &apos;s a little virus of the bacteria .
we created little pieces , we made a mistake correction , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemicals and gave it into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were released from the cells , and came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry , and they said that they understood this model .
they laughed more than you here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually building your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 580,000 letters genetic codes , and so we thought we could build it in cassettes from the size o
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really failure .
when we sequenced the genome in 1995 in 1995 , the mistake was at a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes . if we had used the original sequence , they would never be possible .
one part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to overlave with other 50 letters , to build smaller sub-sittings together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built saterials .
think about it : we have a four-letter code , a , c , c , g .
triplets of these letters -- these letters code about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single determination for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
beginning , we just signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
we could just construct them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair them and put together again .
and we &apos;ve started making pieces , beginning with pieces of five to seven thousands of letters , these approached together to make 24,000 letters together to put them together , up to 72,000 .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces of surplus so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of creating what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of the automation .
so , this looks like a basketball playfof .
if we went to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s overwhelming all possibilities of modern molecular biology , and
we knew about a mechanism of the homologist recombination , which biology can use to repair dna that can some pieces like this .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s one organism called denococcus radioduranure of the three million wheels of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything came back together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dried , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move for looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
and here &apos;s a commodition of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve been using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we &apos;
this is not an electron microscope it &apos;s a regular microscope .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are recordings over six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve just been doing recently .
that &apos;s over 850,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the biggest molecule with defined structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to express it with a script size of 10 and without a distance , it would be about 144 pages , just to express this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how are we going to activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in exactly as we are : you just take the nucleus out and gives another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clone .
in archabecteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but only recently we showed that you can do a complete transplant of a cell to the other and activate them .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . rough said , these two are from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing than
the new chromosome went to the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process something further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species that have taken a second chromosome or a third of somewhere , every time thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time that &apos;s changed a lot from biology .
there are enzymes that are called the restriction enzymes that actually digest the dna .
the chromosome that we were in the cell was nothing ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve introduced .
it was expressed in the cell and realized the other chromosome as a stranger material , and that &apos;s how we had one cell with a new chromosome .
it sold up blue because of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transpared .
it may sound like genomic alchimists , but we can do by shifting the software dna , things are pretty dramatic .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not the genesis -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years evolution .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which massive new education could be based on this digital design .
why would we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re about six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has existed in 1964 ; within 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it will be a challenge to offer that for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billion betters oil . these are hundreds of million betters a day .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material that lands in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components from the future .
the electronic industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of that .
we &apos;re in first line in the boundaries of biological reality and on those of our ideas .
we have technologies because of these fast synthesis , to do what we call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or optimize these processes to optimize new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just only selection . we can select for lifestyle , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a recording of real design software that we &apos;re actually working with , which you actually sit and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like . we know exactly like their genetic code will look like .
so we &apos;re focusing on fourth generation fuels .
they recently saw maize to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels of the second and the third generation that are relatively coming out that are going to have much higher sugarities , like octan or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to have a great influence without any more improvement of the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as the sta
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first ones with fuels of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discoveries of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1966 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one-and-a-half miles deep , nearly cooking water temperatures .
it transforms in methane around using hydrogen as an energy source .
we &apos;re studying whether we can use co2 that could be easy to production , converting the co2 in the fuel to power that process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we &apos;ve really -- moderate goals like the replacement of the entire petrochemical industry , right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise ? a main source of the ener
but that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re working on is to use the same approaches for the development of vaccines .
they &apos;ve seen it with the flu this year , we &apos;re always behind that , and you have a dollar too little when it comes around the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building recombinant vaccines in the previous .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes , today can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and potentially eucaryonts .
we &apos;re light years from improving people . our goal it &apos;s only that we have an opportunity to survive the possible thing . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to get back to explain how the machine works .
now , it &apos;s like . and for all of those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than one billionth of the seconds at the beginning of the universe -- and that up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathing ambitious .
this is the machine underneath genes .
we take images of these mini-big bangs in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 40 feet in the diameter , 22 meters in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction to see the size of the scale .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine was going on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused immens jewels in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radian particle that was the whole track around the lhc , then intentionally collided with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the greatest jewel , or this , when somebody was visiting the google side and the face so found .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific effect .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires spend 13 thousand amples when the machine goes on high performance .
now , the engineers among them are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that , because if you cool them very far , they become so-called superconductors .
by minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can stretch the tension .
in one of the connections , between over nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manufacturing defect .
and by heating the wires little bit and 13 thousands of americans suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
well , that &apos;s all more impressive when you imagine that the magnets went over 20 tons and shifted around about 80 percent .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we were doing .
we conditioned them , repairing them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc is going to be back functional .
we &apos;ll turn it up , and we expect the first data in june or july , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
well , of course , in some ways , the debate that &apos;s the value of science and engineering to these limits . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we &apos;re going out about our limitations , forms the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , when he was defending the useless experiments of his supply , his attention was finished that ther
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever .
however , there &apos;s something that &apos;s happening in my life and my career that made me rethink my relationship with this work .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called e- eat , prayy , love -- that decided that all my previous books went to the world , and a big mega-event , international be
the result is , no matter where i come , they &apos;re going to be treated like i &apos;m going to go .
seriously -- that &apos;s going on .
for example , they &apos;re concerned about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to operate this success ?
don &apos;t you have any fear that you would continue their entire lives , and never create a book that &apos;s interested in anybody in the world ? never ?
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remind myself about 20 years ago , when i first told me as a teenager , that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of anxiety response .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid of having success ?
do you &apos;re not afraid that you &apos;re killing your humility ?
don &apos;t you have a fear that you &apos;re going to get your life long , and you &apos;re never going to do something , and that you &apos;re going to die on a scratch of deseases -- your mouth f
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and that &apos;s what i always had .
and i have a lot more things that nobody was going to do .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
but when it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this and ask me , why ?
is this reasonable ?
is it logical that somebody should be expected to do the work that he feels professionally ?
and what &apos;s exactly with the creative enterprises that they make us uncertain about the mutual state -- in a way that they don &apos;t do other professions ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked to be afraid if he was afraid of being chemists .
with your chemist blockage , john , how are you going to do with this ?
it just didn &apos;t came , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemists haven &apos;t got the centuries of alcohol consumption people over the centuries .
we wrote this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but not just the writers , but the creatives of all geners , seem to have this reputation to have mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitters of deaths of really great heads alone from the 20th century alone that died young and often of your hand .
and even those who actually didn &apos;t actually come to suici they were really neglected by their talents .
norman mailer said short before his death in his last interview : every one of my books had killed me a little bit forward . so each of my books had killed me a little bit . &quot;
there &apos;s an extraordinary statement that you can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been knowing these kinds of statements for so long ago , somehow we accepted the idea of so much and collectively accepted that 
the question i &apos;d like to ask everybody here today is : is this idea for you completely okay ?
don &apos;t you feel like that ? because with only one inch . i don &apos;t want to feel with this notion at all .
i think they &apos;re disgusting .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to look at how she &apos;s going to take over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we live our great creative encouragements .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start by starting to do this dark path of the guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 work in me .
and it &apos;s extremely probably that everything i &apos;m going to write about the world as the world that came after the driving success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it right now , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here -- it &apos;s probably that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought ?
these are the kinds of thoughts that somebody can bring somebody to start drinking four in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather do that work that i love .
so the question is , how ?
after a couple of time of reflection seems to me that i can continue to write to write a kind of protective psychological construct .
somehow , i &apos;ve got to find a way in writing to write a safe distance between me and my very natural engineering about how the reaction will be on the writing .
while i was looking for models for models to do that , i &apos;ve been looking for other societies , and i tried to find other societies to see if they can help creativity with the emotional risks t
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close back .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity of people come , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of diviner spirit that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- for unknown , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine senses of creativity of demons .
from socrates , we know that he believed he had a demon who shared him wisdom from further .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of local creative spirit of a genius ...
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic divine creature that it was literally living in the walls of an artist material -- about like dobby , the house -- the outcome and the artist at wo
this is brilliant -- there is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that i talked about the follows of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected before that , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this body-less genius that you helped .
when your work is following -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
everybody knew that your genius was something .
so people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual to the center of the universe -- all of gods and mysterie
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people like this or those artists call a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i &apos;ve got to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know , i think that i think , i think , to allow the person that he thinks he or she was like the desks and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a 
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
that &apos;s designed , and it &apos;s generating all these innovitable expectations on the success .
i think that this success pressure has countered our artists over the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change ?
perhaps to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t take rational humanism &apos;s thoughts for 500 years of rational humanism .
and certainly , there are people in this audience that would really limited scientific scientific doubts about the idea of -- basically -- feels that apply people and apply their projects .
i &apos;m not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i &apos;m going to do is why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes the same sense like everything i &apos;ve heard when it went to explain the absolute crazy to explain creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows that it ever tried to do -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , he can sometimes feel paranomically .
i was recently such an encounter when i met the extraordinary american poeter ruth stone , who was over 90 is who was over 90 , and she said that she was growing up outside the fields , and she said
and she said it would be like a thundering train from air .
the country was going to work on them .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew she could only do one such a moment , and that was -- in your words -- races like the devil .
she ran up like the devil to the house while she was followed by this poem , and it was only about that she had to get enough to a piece of paper and a pen , so that if it could come through through
in other paints , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house and the poem started rolling through them and she missed it . she said
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments where it missed it almost .
so she &apos;s running the house and looks after the paper and the poem drives through it , and she &apos;s going through a pen that just goes through you and then -- it was like going down with her
and she got the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back in her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came in and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the first word for the first .
when i heard this , i thought that &apos;s incredible -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on . it &apos;s exactly how my creative process .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a malter . and i &apos;m going to work every day at the same time , and sweat , move me and really uncomfortable .
but even in my masternian , sometimes this thing stripped .
and i guess that many of you have done this as well .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we relate to the relationship without losing our minds , but keep us on the opposite even in mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to create this , the musician tom waits can interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was the embodiment of the modern artist , who was trying to dominate these uncontrollable creative pulses that lived in him and come
but then he became older and more quieter . he told me that he did one day on a fast road in los angeles . and then everything changed for him .
he was driving with high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody that &apos;s often difficult for him , and he wants them . it &apos;s powerful . he &apos;s listening , but he can
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he &apos;s got no cassette recorder .
so he starts to rise this old fashion in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to lose from this song from this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not creating it . i don &apos;t .
but instead of going into panic , he just stopped up .
he ended up the whole thought , and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , sorry , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
so look like i can just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheaper moment , when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else today .
go and source leonard cohen .
his whole work process has changed after that .
not the work themselves . it was continued to continue to dark like him and ever .
but the process and the heavy delivery that surrounded him , was up when he took the genius out of where he came out , and left him back where he came from . he realized that it had to be an interna
it could give you an obvious , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange , extraordinary thing , which was not all tom .
when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way i worked and it &apos;s been saving me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of eat , pray , love , and i fell in one of these tricks in the doubt where we all do , when we work something and doesn &apos;t wo
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just stop the project .
but then i remembered how tom had talked into the free heaven , and i tried .
so , i loved my view from the manuscript , and i was talking to my comment towards an empty corner of the space .
and i talked about is : listen , you think , you , and i know both if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my blame , right ?
because you can see , i &apos;ve got all i &apos;ve got investing . i don &apos;t have anymore than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to shoot here and contain your fraction of the development .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that . you know what , then you know .
i &apos;m still writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i &apos;d like to please to protocol that i was here today for my part of the job .
because -- at the end , it &apos;s like following . in the deserts , north africa &apos;s deserts have collapsed with sacred dances and music gathering for hours -- all the time .
these finals were always great , because the dancers were professionally , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , happened something special . one of the performers were actually transmitted .
and i know you know what i mean because i know you &apos;ve all seen such a performance in your life .
it was like silence and the dancer through some kinds of ports , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he did ever before -- 1,000 nights before . but everything is approaching together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to be human .
it &apos;s been recovered by the inside and it &apos;s increased by the bottom , and everything got through a divine fire .
when this happened , people knew what that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : allah , allah , allah , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical founto : when the morning spray spain came up with this . the outcome changed this in the centuries of allah , allah , ole , ole , ole , ole , ole , ole , ole , ole , ole , ol
when a contractor in spain has something impossible , something magical : it &apos;s allah , ole , ole , ole , great , great , bravo of unable , there &apos;s a fluid view on god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer himself is waking up , and realizes that it &apos;s 14 outs on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t carry a fine of god inside .
it &apos;s just an aging mortality with painful knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to these highs .
and perhaps never become god &apos;s name calls when he turns , but what should he begin with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so much , if they didn &apos;t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of their own of them came from them .
if you &apos;re just believed that they &apos;re a lead -- from an unbelievable source for a season time of your life that &apos;s passed on somebody else , when you &apos;re done .
when we start thinking about it , that &apos;s changing everything .
and so i started thinking , and so i think of safety in the past months , while i was working on the book , which is going to be appearing -- when the dangerous , frightening , strongly expected suc
what i have to say to myself if i &apos;m crazy , if i &apos;m crazy , it &apos;s not afraid .
didn &apos;t disappear .
just do your job .
it &apos;s continued to contribute to your contributions , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius that you &apos;re asked to side , decides to show you a short moment through your effort , and then oll ! !
and if not , dance yet your dance .
and oil ! for you , all for you .
i believe it , and i feel like we should teach .
for you , for you , all for you , just for you to be the human love and the meaning to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
ol !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice camp , which for nearly three million years , the size of the lower 48 states had been scratched 40 percent .
but it doesn &apos;t press the seriousness of this particular problem , because it shows not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice camp is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it &apos;s growing in the winter and script in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-leak recording of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
that &apos;s what &apos;s red with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue , this is the year &apos;s ice in winter , and it &apos;s dropping in the summer .
so what &apos;s called , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which leaves out of the body .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming does the frozen reason for the arctic ocean where there &apos;s great amounts of frozen carbon , which is when he &apos;s going to be implemented by microbes 
compared to the entire contribution of climate changing in the atmosphere , it could double if we translate that critical point .
already today , in some flat seas in alaska methane from the water .
professor kate &apos;s university in alaska is traveling with another workforce to another flat last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how we &apos;re going to do .
and one reason is , this enormous home storage warms greenland from the north .
this is an annual deal water .
but the volumes are essentially larger than ever .
this is the engineering sulf river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know what the sea level rises through country melting here , it flows into the sea .
these rivers are taking rapids .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice ice on the planet .
last month researchers struggled that the entire continent has a negative ice .
and the west antarctica that &apos;s stopped across a couple of underwater islands is particularly strong in melting .
this is 20 feet levels , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third-largest ice ice , you see up the top of new seas that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world are getting half their drinking water from this melting water .
in the end , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the waters have blown up .
but when they &apos;re going , the most drinking water is going to fall .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the snip of the sierra was seen .
this is the memory bags .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read they &apos;re serious .
this extraction around the world leads to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the disasters all over the world have in a really extraordinary and previous before that they have never been able to do .
four times as many over the last 30 years , like in the previous 15 years .
this is a completely unstandard development pattern .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 -- 25 million tons every day into the oceans every day .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , from the american continent of western and both of the indian sub-continents , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline in the ocean in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next deforestation , which is 20 percent , the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states are one of the biggest pollutions , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other carbon factories .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a change .
here are the ones that have been struggled in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
and yet , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the coal industries and oil industries have spent a quarter billion dollars last calendar to apply clean coal , which is a contradiction .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of carbon .
you &apos;ve probably seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the second biggest waste flow at america .
this happened christmas .
one of the advertisements of the carbon industry around christmas was this .
frosty of the carbon is a foughter , quick guy .
it &apos;s going into the shell and fills in america , and he &apos;s going to help our economy .
frosty , the carbon man gets cleaners every day .
it &apos;s affordable and lovely , and workers stay in lone and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful constructor is the ladder of maseey coal .
let me say something very clear . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry , they don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has called two campaigns .
this is one , part of her .
in coalrgy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve been set up to the top line to spend a significant sense of money to get a web action to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s going to smell good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave it to us .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s do a tour of that modern clean carbon .
fantastic : this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , burning coal of one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean technology that you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is today , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thing that connects them all , our dependence of carbon-based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to free us out of that mission .
america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work , make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
services america new . find out more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a nevelopment of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels that stick our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good jobs .
services america new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , alone .
if you want to come together , go together . &quot;
we need to come far , and that &apos;s quickly .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to think about the time of your childhood when they were playing with building locks .
while they realized how to extract the hands and access the skots and moves , they learned to think about understanding and problems through understanding and change spatial contexts .
the spatial thinking is enough to connect how we understand a lot of our environments .
as an information , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my colleague , patti and my colleague , jeevan kalanthi , i started wondering : what if we could use comput
and that question was so proposing that we decided to explore the answer and developed simply .
in short , a sitable is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can move with your hand , they can perceive each other , they can capture their movements , and they have a screen and a fun .
much more importantly , they &apos;re physically , why you can just move through the building location through what the hands and access to .
and the situation is an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data .
and when these tools are going to become physical and consciousness for their movements , recognize each other and perceive the humanities of our dealing with them , then we can start with explorati
i &apos;m starting with some simple examples .
this situation is configurated for the video , and if i &apos;m in a direction , the video is playing forward , if i got him in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so when i put them up next to each other , that &apos;s your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by another , they also notice that , and you can get something nervous .
and they feel their movements and their own .
and an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , such as colors , how to do this with fluids .
in this case , we &apos;ve configured three sitables as a color corporation , and i can use them to get color in the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we exaggerate it , we can go back a little bit .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or logic games , where we give people the possibility of the fast extinction and want to see the results immediat
here i am ... this is a fibonacci consequence that i &apos;m creating with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words that &apos;s kind of a mixture of scrable and boggle .
basically , you get every round on every sense of random , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re actually created about a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you have a new letter combination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some children who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try it and recorded a video of it .
they &apos;ve really loved it .
an interesting thing about these kinds of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; brends words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are a couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest beat tester there in the bottom right .
it turns out he wanted to stack the sittable .
so for him , they were just buildings .
this is an interactive trick .
we wanted to develop a teaching tool for speakers .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by running the sittable of the table that shows this character .
here he makes the sun .
the sun is going up with the sun .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor into the scene .
the orange other tractor .
good work ? yes !
by shaking the sittable , and they &apos;re sitting next to each other , he can interact the characters ...
... invent its own story .
hello .
it &apos;s a story of open end , and he can decide how it evolved .
flying cat .
the last example that i have today to show it is a music sequence for live , which we &apos;ve developed recently and in the sittable as notes , like leadership and drugs .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose that you want to use .
and you can pick these notes into the sequence that you can attach in any patterns .
and you put them up by just keeping a sound situation to a sequence sentence .
there are effects that you can change live , like hal and filters .
you connect him with a particular tone , and then you &apos;ll tell him .
and then still released effects like pace and strength that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting where we put the leadership into two sequence sittables and to order them in a series , they expand and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i &apos;m going to add a base .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of things .
and now i connect the filter with the drug so i can take the effect of live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the speed in one or the other direction .
and now i connect the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can take the sequence while they &apos;re doing .
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but can improvise ; they &apos;re extending or short .
and finally , i can study the whole sequence by tending the loud-state seat .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new personal computer interfaces that are better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way is that we stand on the threshold of this new generation of tools to interacting with digital media , that bring the information into our world that
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to conversations with you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , what should be biohacking ?
i &apos;ve got to stop a little bit , and that &apos;s what biohacking is engaging with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been studying me for a few years with the biohacking , and that &apos;s what i started , because i wanted to know more accurate , and it &apos;s
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to be kind of closer to the matter , like this .
i think that molecular biology in general now , so much generally , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
it &apos;s extremely important now , and it &apos;s much more important , and much more importantly , is going to be more important in the future .
there &apos;s so controlled things like these entire genetically changed plants .
there &apos;s now craig venter in the u.s. , who &apos;s trying to make biofuel , so gasoline from algae .
and under then , there are things that are completely going on , which most people are not aware of , for example , washing levels that allow us to wash with four degrees of washes are also genetica
and the list you can continue endless .
and so from the interest in this one of this technology , i &apos;ve been going up there .
what &apos;s now hacking ?
most people know that from the software area .
computers , and then it &apos;s always going to break in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claw data and so on .
that &apos;s kind of sad for the hacker scenes , because it doesn &apos;t meet what she actually started , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s what the software hackers , in the &apos; 70s , eighty years with computer basis , and that &apos;s what the internet came out .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be an access problem that simplifies like things , so an any problem , to ask a question , and
and it &apos;s been raised with software , but there &apos;s also in the electronics , and there &apos;s also a whole bunchest that does with electronics circles make all sorts of driving things .
and now there &apos;s also towards biology , and there &apos;s this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an abstract code that yes , because it &apos;s dynamic , bec
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program , and you can hack it , and that &apos;s what i find incredibly fascinating , and i was just going to get a lot of deeper with it .
it &apos;s actually only two-thousand eight really shape , these networks .
there &apos;s hackerial dot organ , which is originally from switzerland , that &apos;s with europe and with a cooperation in india based network , but now has members or active people all over the 
that &apos;s a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists to deal with these technologies and process the creatively , there &apos
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find such a locker access to having a playful dealing with it .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself biom dot there .
this is from the u.s. a network , which is actually more like that kind of forum where you &apos;re making , and discussing online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of business , and that &apos;s where you &apos;re asked questions like this .
and from these networks that made the entire popular , has developed a scene that i &apos;d like to portrait .
here in the picture on the left , you see biocurious , which is a hacker space , so basically , sort of school , such a private school , a private school , nonprofit institution , where everybody ca
children , old , all sorts of people are going around with them just simply dealing with it , and they look at what you can do when these laboratory protocols .
on the bottom left is a group in indonesia , house of natural fibers , who is , but there &apos;s pretty long .
longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also engaging in an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electronics , and combine that in a pretty distant way .
one group of ankara that i &apos;ve ever learned about a while ago , who has a student group that likes to convey the public what they learn , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what dnna is .
and i &apos;ve open up in the other picture at the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition to the subject .
and that &apos;s , you know , that &apos;s mostly young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually all uniting is this fascination at technology .
and what you can do with it , and what you &apos;re talking about is , okay , what do you know , what do you know , what do you want to do , have your interest to bring you with this ?
so , ok , to hack biology , you need somehow material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
the relationship that you usually understand under a lab , these are so sort of distant machines , extremely department , extremely distanted , just for surgery , trained academics with ph.d. and so
and our approach was to say , ok , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each every coffee automat has actually higher developed technology than most lab devices , that &apos;s really the way .
and one of these premises with this premise , then , for example , brian degger in england tries to put together a minimal lab and then taken some straight printing place , a heat and , you know , s
so everybody who &apos;s been engaged in a soup that he left too long , even made .
and i then tried this in my lab home trying to expand a little bit , and then i bought second-hand equipment on ebay and made a little bit of dna analysis , trying to make a paternal test , so that 
now that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , but now .
there &apos;s the bottom in the picture , you see the lab , in leadership , so there &apos;s such an opposite garage with also any possible laboratory that the university has measured , a group in p
and this is biocuurious , which is also mentioned hacker-space , this yea , such a kind of policy school basically for molecular biology .
and so , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively heterogens , so this is stopped by people who &apos;re alone who &apos;s alone to greater organizations , and that &apos;s already doing the m
but always the approach that it should be simple and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group when we were aware of ourselves , ok , so we &apos;re here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are always ch
and then you came from the do-it yourself site of the founders , and i said , ok , we &apos;ve got to meet real y , and then organized two events , one in london , two thousands of ten , and shortly
and then it was also about , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values , and what is our goal , our basis ?
and then we &apos;ve been expanding a code-of-conduct .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just the wishes , his and what &apos;s moving him , expressed , then .
and that &apos;s where i think , is a good code .
and then we &apos;ve got them connected , but that &apos;s yes , i think i &apos;ve been relatively well , people are really convinced by this .
and we &apos;ve even tried to bring it back to the academia world , but it &apos;s kind of not like that .
so i think we &apos;re out of the biohacce sence in the view , even a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what for projects we &apos;re going to do ?
one project i made with the hackeria network in switzerland was that we wanted to build something called optical case or optical pincet .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser ray on one in the room , you can catch that little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then you move into this focus , like that kind of track track basic
this works really , this is going to work in the academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we may have taken a webcam that goes up , then you had a microscope that &apos;s growing up about 400
that &apos;s what you see .
and then we &apos;ve put a dv.d burner , and then the burner went out the laser , and then trying to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of this .
another project that &apos;s from the french group out of the french group out of paris , and that &apos;s gone , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s got like this , like this , such a brain wave measurement , something like this , so he &apos;s been engaging with neurobiology , his nickey is sam neurohchie .
he then built on this one , and in the cooperation with the museum , that was running .
and then they could go into the room , put it on that chair , put this helmet .
then their brain waves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , they &apos;re different lights in the room .
it &apos;s a pretty send project .
another thing from the united states that has also to do with this fathernity story is that the p.c. , that &apos;s the pcr. , that &apos;s the polymera chain reaction , complicated word .
so , it &apos;s about copying genes to replicate , dna , fragments , so you can make it visible .
so if i &apos;m doing this that the profilers at the action , they go , collects any hair samples , and then they make that method , and then they can say that , and then they can say , ok , this ha
and the machines that are doing something like this , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you buy commercially , the cheapest goes down in a four-thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbies , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got two bustes and said , ok , that &apos;s what we do simpler and cheaper , and then freely available hardware , electronics , electronics , that this device combined , and now th
i think somehow six hundred dollars or something like that .
but at any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s actually in a framework where it &apos;s clearly available .
so i think it &apos;s a very comfortable hack .
a project i started building last was to build a gene gun .
the gene guy is , like this kind of air pressure , which is going to be so far , two centimeters or something .
you put the dna on the gold particles , and the gold particles then into this air print , and then i shot them on journeys and then brought them together with that .
so the device that you see is that didn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s so my prototype that looked pretty distraction , like this , the thing on the one , the thing on the one , the thing on it , and that was high , and that was high , the thing was up
and then i took a sand donor , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
a sand donor , when you make the full with water , the enough pressure pressures , so i think that &apos;s so fortunate about it .
and so you can then accelerate the particles strong enough , and then they &apos;re also going into the ground .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros , or something like that , sanding ponds like that .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically powerful .
so , and that &apos;s the moment that &apos;s also the corner of the scene to increase this availability of technology and also extend the information and determination that more people can engage .
because in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little expertise of it , and also no chance to form them .
because , when you read about it , from second-literature , that &apos;s not the same when you made it ourselves or seen it .
and i think technology gets more important in our modern societies .
and if you also want to meet sense of informed citizens in society , and you can tell you , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it to make it and understand it .
and that companies under the words of open knowledge and citice science .
so that you &apos;re a citizen that you &apos;re going to put into the citizens with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the concrete from the biohackers .
these are the people who got into at least officially on the website , d.ix-bio-bio-do-org website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interestingly , they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are less people that are actually existed .
so i know from some who didn &apos;t get in .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
partly also with these hacker spaces , so these places combined together .
and that &apos;s at the beginning .
as i said , it &apos;s only started .
and hackerspace , which is the computer hackerspace , because the cob base in berlin was the first new hundred five .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yeah , infrastructure centers that are represented everywhere in the world .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to spread up , and then we &apos;re similarly connected , so that this is also connected to people .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and also try themselves .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible when you &apos;ve got there enough curiosity and put enough energy , then you get far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
that &apos;s a question that moves me very much as a designer , but also in the area of usability and before all the things in the area of our experience .
it &apos;s about how to measure people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create a possible experience .
because i think that the interactive media is addressing us archian , cognitive models , so paradigms that have been programmed in our biological memory ago , and that we &apos;ve just been programm
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this high technology that you &apos;re interested in , but in fact , the future brings into the future , but in fact , the future is
what &apos;s because now , archaic models ?
i &apos;ve written for four words , and i would like to explain .
archaic cognitive models , and these are the models that we &apos;ve done in pre-industrial times .
these archaic models heard that we have a principle natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go again to that , and i &apos;m going to prove you to try to prove that they have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is , we &apos;ve been able to do because of these archaic models , we &apos;ve been able to talk very , very significantly , although we &apos;re using a codificated language today
and the third area is actually explaining itself .
we all know that the interactive media is definition nonlinear , which involves linearity , and what of course says that we feel linearity today .
the fourth point is that the story is a place of information passenger .
so how about the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
and i &apos;d like to prove you this .
how many doors have the house where you live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen at the moment .
they go through this house where they live , and look at how many doors are .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they &apos;re virtualizing reality and they &apos;re virtualizing without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to give you the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.c. lab , and we can actually get that all the time .
and this fortune to virtualize reality , which have been required people in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have a book .
or they didn &apos;t have photography .
they had no mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in that head , the memory played .
in this head , knowledge , and with these virtual images , the imagination , they were passed also .
and so it &apos;s also so powerful in us that we can deal with the virtuality of good .
and the interesting thing about it is , if i can make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going on .
and the interesting thing about this is that at that time , human producer and medium was ourselves at the same time .
now , if you think a piece of thinking .
what &apos;s media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
but that &apos;s the same thing to talk again .
essentially the tool of information has been for ever stories .
shaman , priests , so-called knowledgers , were for extra to preserve knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very powerful to stories .
the author of the book the storytelling animal , jonathan god , we still have a thousand hours with the reception of stories .
this means for a kid who spent it to achieve that the great year of his life has spent most of his life with the reception of stories .
now we think our love of stories depends on that we have seen as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
this is much more back into the cultures of the industrial times .
but for me , in the area of interactive media , as particularly impressive , we &apos;ve been interested in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
i &apos;ve brought you an example by the north american tribe from the nootak indian .
and the lives lived in the coast of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to navigate them somehow , from island from island to get food .
and they did this with so-called lead maps .
you might know that if you &apos;re a little bit interested in this , from the australian individuals .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but they have used the so-called songline , or the dream path .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be trained about songs .
where the language was subjected from subjected transportation .
that is , you navigated sounds and rhythm .
and these sounds , and these rhythms have the geology , the topography of a region , and of course , that you could defrage these songs , and that &apos;s going to get together together , and they c
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top of about to the top ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what happened there ?
it &apos;s the so-called machine age .
we &apos;ve been moving before in something called the vice age .
it &apos;s the machine age , and happens is the book and happened is the photography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and that their own production of our individual memories have been supplied to external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we &apos;ve lost a piece of god &apos;s piece of virtualizing .
virtuality has become stranger for us and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the brighton university , is so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the picture , the internet , and so on , which we call these mass
let &apos;s make a little between balance .
from the edge age to the machine age .
what does influence on our thinking about , and on our memories ?
and then the influences of the industrial cultures are .
and they &apos;re going to be over the centuries of the centuries and more through the implications of the machine age .
that means , instead of reminding us , we standardized , we standardized , in mass common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract of an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think about imagery in pictures that don &apos;t have in images , but we &apos;re codifying you our language .
we have used to things that things happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions like non-linearity .
what we remained is the storytelling .
still , we &apos;re very , very powerful as an information instrumentation .
the question is , what &apos;s now ?
we had the equivalent of age , we had the machine age , and we &apos;ve got the cyber age .
that sounds very sparkly , and it sounds very science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber-age , which bring us to discover these opportunities back to our skills .
this is about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearity ; it &apos;s about storytelling .
i want to explain that for a little bit .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google glass , for example , what makes us combine the virtual world with the real world , which is called our afficiency of virtualization , which is called the virtualization of 
another example is something called virtual reality .
so , of course , the relationship of my talk might sound , where we don &apos;t move physically in not existing , virtual worlds , after the model of the holodeck .
and others are another example , the ambients , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human intelligent .
all of that needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated , and i hope that the video works , brought brought a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the baccle orard of michael burk , and kathain crence , joris class and janj mortz .
and the two things are here today .
maybe your short could stand up , so you can talk about the two of these things about the project .
and this project i &apos;ve brought in as an example of how again in these archian , cognitive models are addressed .
the whole thing is a game i need to say .
which is , of course , the storytelling comes extremely , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you probably have that any people have people around consumers , or that they play with any console in the hand .
anyway , you &apos;re doing this inside .
this is a game for outside .
and this thought i &apos;ve been talking about the outside world , so i &apos;m discovering the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , with the real world .
and i apologize i have to shortcut so much .
you can then explain much better , there &apos;s a lot more behind them .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;m discovering a city by looking at which places were positive or negative .
and so i get a very different sight from the city , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones and positive zones in this way , and that &apos;s a very different virtual m
and we can love to look at that now .
oh , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation from what you see in the same .
of course , this virtual world is in the walls of our cities , yeah .
and with a kind of pocket lamp , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that together my talk , and that &apos;s in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the very age , and that we can activate us a 
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked , whether this sack is a speaking sack , and i &apos;m going to talk about .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s inside .
but i &apos;m going to do it a little bit curious .
yes , children are nature of curious or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creature of house , so , of course , with the issue of curiosity , and how curios changes our thinking again , and why do we might lose curiosity and why are we lost curiosity and so on 
that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re interested in actually being designed by the actual design .
if professors are curious , then they &apos;re going to go into the research semeters .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half year .
a research semetter , natural our interface design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why do you start to engage with so natural , archaic forms of communication , interaction and so on .
and that &apos;s where i just hold one of these little devices , because things should always become more intuitive , and more natural , useful , and you &apos;ve got to look at what &apos;s actuall
and before the background , i &apos;ve designed in the area of natural our interface design , so the next generation in the process of human computers in which our tools , or how our tools , or how 
so i &apos;ve been busy with it , when , of course , or intuitive .
you might have to look at that again .
why does that happen ?
so if we &apos;re looking at the development of our society , here &apos;s short , then we &apos;re going to move from the third into the fourth social generation or society form .
so from modern computer society .
every society is controlled by a primary measure .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through the language .
that means you &apos;ve found a shared language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate into the same cave , or other areas , cities created or villages , and has created tha
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
also , you had to learn , so no small one can talk about , but we &apos;re learning it &apos;s naturally , of course .
and that &apos;s been reduced by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was at the time , because , of course , the living language started manifesting in the form of script , which means what fluid and alive is , i start and minimulate it in stone , and that &apos
the after like myself , and when i change , it &apos;s a very different competition than if there &apos;s an alive sort of thing .
but successive then moved this script as a primary medium , received .
and then the next generation where we &apos;re actually primarily living today .
that &apos;s what &apos;s through pressure and print writing with guttenberg and others .
at the time , it was just as an afrortation , where idel , clean and others have said : because you actually start reading , then the people start reading , and that &apos;s completely fatal .
and now we get into the next generation and the exciting thing , such a generation change is only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal phase that we &apos;re doing this .
and of course that confuses us , of course , because we see on the one hand the new media , social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what brans on the old , don &apos;t say that in the last ng horse is meat , and not beef or other phenomena , which is just wanting to take t
and these two worlds crawled each other , new and old .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computing society , very many mechanisms , principles and archaic paradigms from from tribal society .
but not at the local level , but it &apos;s on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not , if i think locally , ecologically , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , then this won &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village has become a global village with the same principles , possible , of course , possible , but also the total transparency .
as you know , at the time in the village , who &apos;s going on with whom , and when , that &apos;s what happens today about this extension of ourselves through these mobile endings on global level 
it &apos;s that we know globally , and we know faster and faster and better .
as earlier happened on the village .
before the background , i &apos;ve been engaging with it , which means that , what &apos;s natural for us , what we might have learned for us , what &apos;s instinctive for us , so what does the dif
because often gets people , they can &apos;t do it usefully so everybody can deal with it .
so you &apos;ve got to engage with it , what does that mean , and not only change it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and of course , when , of course , is something intuitive , and how can i take an impact on it and they &apos;re actually designing the things that they &apos;re useful , so possible , because they 
and then you engage in the study , with the issue of perception and perception psychology .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you start and saying , okay , now i &apos;ll just look into the inner self .
and what &apos;s because there &apos;s actually there ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re going in there ?
and what means , of course , intuitively , and how does our channels of perception , and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs said that you &apos;ve said you new to day , deper to develop , how it works .
so you really have to look in the detail if i want to make something friendly or intuitively handbable , which is the core .
and that &apos;s what you see is that you &apos;re on our seven senses , most people think we &apos;ve just thinking about five , now it &apos;s actually seven , there &apos;s certainly the next one
and looking , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many of use the word , but it doesn &apos;t know what it means .
but i &apos;ve got to understand in core , when it gets information to information , when when information will know from data information and from information , so i know how to make things intuiti
and of course , how design impacts perception .
we &apos;re looking at this , when i design things , then i can make them confusing as on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can actually design them intuitivel
so much more naturally , in a bunch , but i see directly , where is salt and pepper inside .
and when i tell somebody , salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to think about where is what &apos;s inside .
and then on the left is just intuitive and then hopefully that no sugar is inside , there &apos;s no sugar inside the salt .
but also our perception itself , how they take us .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks larger than that little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re actually equivalent to our perception , and yet our perception is changing after what conte
does anybody know what that is ?
come on one .
pattern recognition should work .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s rather than my glasses .
so it &apos;s circle .
a second circle starts to correlate or associate .
and when i get one of these halfobiles , then we &apos;re not only seeing an unit , which is circle , circle , but we see an unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different
that &apos;s what you call the design law or design psychology that affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for designers , they have the most in the first semester , the great designs .
design rest of the close that the continuity and so on .
there &apos;s one of the things that &apos;s been forgotten in the third .
but that &apos;s an essentially important thing , when you want to design things at the same time , intuitively .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is that .
sounds first of all , but it &apos;s actually exciting when you &apos;re engaging with it .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes forward , and now you think we &apos;re looking back from the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re first seeing behind the back .
and they project an assumption that you see something you recognize , for example , circle .
that is , we &apos;re just projecting ourselves before we see it that brings back to the back into our seeing , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got this kind of cognitive feedback , you &apos;ve projected what you want to see .
that &apos;s what &apos;s there , that &apos;s when they get back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t come out and says , &quot; it &apos;s really going to be appropriate and sure you see if what you &apos;re seeing is what you &apo
and then you go back to the back , and then it &apos;s going to see it .
so an entirely exciting process , like certain things , and what happens for milliseconds that happen to these things .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
that &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who knows what .
does anybody look something specific ?
a dalmating , exactly .
once i saw that , that there &apos;s a dalmater in it , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the dalmater is .
now you &apos;re looking at the dalmmating .
and further , now you &apos;re always looking at it .
that means i &apos;ve actually rolled them up , that you don &apos;t recognize pattern darin , but i &apos;ve conditioned within a shortest time again to see this dog in this controlled picture .
and that &apos;s this projection of seeing , feedback , see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m projecting forward that i see the dalmmater .
i see the dalmating .
so very , very exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gray is not , but here in these rosan masses are actually going on .
does anybody know what three seconds ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something takes three seconds until i sort of from the present in the past loop , then i can also bridge very well waiting that i &apos;ve been doing him by engaging somebody with three se
it has to process it as the present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can get very elegant waiting for example , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what does five milliseconds do ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also an exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of time that you &apos;re in love .
that means , regard , when you know this , look at when you look at how long , because i don &apos;t take the truek for what &apos;s expectively happening .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions that we have .
that means , this first impression happens in a rapidly fast speed how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re interested in the environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the designs are not only engaging with the issue of perceptions and neural processing , or cognitional regonomy , but primary , of course , with the subject of the human object relations
so how a human person goes into certain things around .
there &apos;s once productively the practical functions , so formal aspects or formal aspects .
there are signs of the functions where i know exactly where i have to actually go .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is somebody for such a little table where it &apos;s almost about what &apos;s going on , so horrible amounts of money , even though it &apos;s not th
we &apos;re more likely on the symbolic , on the meaning level , which we &apos;re interested in designs .
back to my actual subject naturally under interface and the theme , which is , of course , is usability .
and usability is always , how can i reach a certain quick , or how can a user in a particular use is possible to effectively and efficient and happiness a goal .
that &apos;s more like that .
how can i do something possible usefully ?
i can use this directly , or i need the handbook or i need the corresponding training for that .
and less usbale or use friendly it is .
that i &apos;m designing this and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better handball .
you have to understand that .
and when you partly the software that we &apos;ve seen , on that , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety percent of our software today &apos;s intuitive , or not useful , the ipad in many areas or
there &apos;s intuitive useful , not only for apple that &apos;s an elementary economic factor , no more elementary success , if i want to use technological devices to human beings .
why ?
because in the rule , we through this new kind of usebility , which is the natural user interfaces , for example , five times faster at our goal .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classic software , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home for four hours , but your employer , or somebody &apos;s falling on the way that he &apos;s been doing them with the four hours .
but i want to say it &apos;s a relative increase for us , of course , is a certain thing for us .
and when we &apos;re going to get in the field of the software , here are the first commands line interfaces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next things came up with the nexronal model or mental model like software erogonists , which would have been an idea of something the metaphor , the metaphor , the metaphor , the metaph
so no longer zeros and one or cryptic code , but there &apos;s a metaphor .
that made that already useful , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of graphic uses works a lot more with behavior .
so , as a design , i designed a lot more common the behavior than that .
that &apos;s such a paradigm shift .
that once in the success , i &apos;m going to be more important for success , just the usabiliti will just become an application .
and when i go one step further into these natural our interfaces , where i &apos;ve been voices , language , the gesture and no longer and cursor the things , i &apos;ll be faster and more immediate
but that &apos;s also leading to the point , when will things will actually more intuitive ?
if you get more intuitive , and then i &apos;m going to stretch my little friend here and look , what does that mean from view of view of cognition , when is actually something intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always intuitive for us humans , if i &apos;ve been able to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t love to think , but it doesn &apos;t like to think .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means if we can look at existing action models from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can make the use of use as a design .
that means i can transmit an intuitive , human action model to a software and make the software software to use .
imagine the question , of course , what &apos;s actually the most intuitive action of us humans , and now i &apos;ve been talking about it .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the ostion model .
that uses each of us , and ostic is an acronym and standing for orienting , selecting , transacting .
that makes every one of you all the time , but he does it unconscious , and yes , intuitively , or partially instinctively .
the model is happening in the womb , and it &apos;s interculturally , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time without that most of us knew that most of us had known that most
on the time , about 50 to 10 thousand times , and so you &apos;ve figured out that it &apos;s going to be less often than a day .
i can now orient this mental action model , selecting , information , transactions transactions to an interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the desk , but not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of an action pattern , an action principle .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of use friendly than the transmission of the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop .
and when i transmit that now , for example , where i &apos;m going to be overlooked as a choice , informing as a choice , i can look at me in the details , and yes , i can look at that somewhere or 
then i can transmit this .
i &apos;m trying to do this in an example .
yes , everybody has eaten pies .
and oversight : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , can zoom out again .
i &apos;m going to get the whole overlook , can now filter on this , and can say , just show me all the things with chocolate , for example .
and once at once , an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach the things like the pieces , down , and they come to me is more natural than when hierarchical organized websites or other mechanisms , can be accessible to these things .
imagination is more important than kowledge , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close , and again , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in that sense , i than
i want to help you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
the first thing that if you &apos;re going to be large as a kid , as baby , is that you care about what kinds of divorces you have , right , and depending on whether your parents have allowed them t
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why everybody who are here and curious about people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
so i &apos;m going to do it right now , practically this whole environmental discussion , world discussion , four years of club-of romes , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and the depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day , they &apos;re giving them scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could only turn through the world &apos;s ocean .
in fact , if we don &apos;t take phosphorus and put it up .
and amazingly , it &apos;s that we &apos;re working here with something that would actually be if course of course , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years of phosphorus , and now through the phosphorus mountain worldwide brought into the environment than it &apos;s used in all nuclear plants .
in the last two-years alone , five thousands of tons of urans have been distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take it all .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less damaging .
so , for example , protection is the environment , for less car .
protect the environment , make less waste .
protect the environment , use less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like i would say , protect your child , it &apos;s only three times instead of five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
when we think about the way to the trial , then our entire earth will become a peace or later .
that &apos;s why thinking about the way to think about .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first of all .
on the ground , over 60 percent of carbon is stored .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and lose between elf-and 30 kilograms per hectare , or the square meter as well .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than new educated .
and of course , we can actually look at the waste problem .
and it &apos;s all packaging or content .
for example , for example , there &apos;s 20 percent of the trash world .
and because we &apos;re older , they &apos;re going to get larger .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re all in the processional stage .
yes ?
one baby needs about six thousands .
and of course , we could reduce this to 10 percent , but what does that make ?
it &apos;s going to balance in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely straightforward .
so the question is , how are we going to do with these ?
here &apos;s an evidence by the way , that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going on with the pigs about the first components of exprements .
the people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s because that &apos;s what you &apos;re like , right ?
traditionally , we think in the environmental discussion , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you try to exist people who , if you say that , if you say , that &apos;s better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , then they &apos;re going to get rich and hostile .
and somebody like al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilizing the human population .
in israel , when you save a human life , you save the earth .
here &apos;s the more you kill , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
when you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants were about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody likes termites , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means that the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working a lot harder than we live , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , you &apos;re in your weight , in the energy consumption , something like
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re looking at how far we &apos;re aware of , what we wanted to achieve and could , and how sad we are that we &apos;ve got a program for example , you can see that , for example 
you can be climate neutral if they don &apos;t exist ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a climate neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means that we want to be dumber than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
fortunately , yeah ?
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem of trees .
there &apos;s still six hundred billion trees alone in the amazon .
you &apos;ve heard some of overpopulation problems from trees ?
that is , all of our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most strictly bio , agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolic products .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back in circles every year .
and we &apos;re too many .
one of them alone .
that means that we feel so guilty on the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bioland , not a bioland , not nature e-prograss , and as they all mean that allow our own extrements back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re many .
it &apos;s sure to be less damaging what oil use is .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it goes around the environment , the highest , not to be there ?
zero emissions , yes ?
you can only have zero missions if they &apos;re not there .
even if you &apos;d shoot now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we make agriculture in brazil in where we win the nutrients back .
we can get directly in this way of getting nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing it in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking directly the waste .
in china , you have a newspaper today , sort of , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid by bringing our nutrients back .
that means that the whole western civilization story draws by that the city has always taken , but given the farmers never something .
and it had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to the cities , and the cities had to keep going forward to their nutrients .
so all of the western empires are always expanding until they didn &apos;t do the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re imploded .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done incredible civilization for five thousand years , because you were always able to bring the nutrients back .
even today , if you invited for food in china , you expect after the food that they &apos;re looking at the toilets .
because it &apos;s inhinity to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat , not for nutrients .
that means you can see the internet , how to win the nutrients .
that &apos;s actually beautiful about this , if you do that , so agriculture , biogas creates , on a hectal country with five thousands of people in favela , which was a farmer about a thousand hund
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate is in the favelas around ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people , possible to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed , through the design , which is just a farmer .
that means the crimes go back .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over hundreds of years in the last two years , none of these facilities were ever sobbed .
you could simply ruin a liter of oil , and then the plant would be ruined for years .
don &apos;t find it .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , possible to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what they want to do , they write in germany , best of all the delivers &apos; statements , that &apos;s in frank .
unfortunately , not in open , but maybe you can help the frankers a little bit .
because the frank force could get the phosphorus best .
and it &apos;s got to back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s going down .
we &apos;ve been using us in holland now over three years .
the global government has explained , they &apos;ll be the first country in the world what phosphorus gets back .
but we need it totally .
understand , there are two countries controlling almost 70 percent of the phosphorus communities around the world .
there &apos;s an opec a bunch of orphans .
that &apos;s six-year-old countries that control 500 percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace through other energy carriers .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s particularly asking what the right thing is .
that means that it &apos;s about effectivity , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , your wife is sad when you &apos;ve currented them , and they come with 40 pounds .
completely inefficient .
but what &apos;s effective , right ?
or take a lipping pen .
a woman in germany is about six commands three kilograms during their lives .
that &apos;s going on .
this isn &apos;t really correctly correctly because we don &apos;t know how much of them is going to pick up .
but a lippins , even in that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but also effectively , yeah ?
anything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but effectivity .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
it &apos;s not to burn the classmation a little bit better and stopping it , and in the burning facility to lose the whole materials for circulations , but first time , how do you get the circulatio
imagine mozart efficiently .
yes ?
when i invite you for dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tablet with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; well ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you &apos;re in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that is , everything that counts in life , it &apos;s not about avoiding .
the whole environmental discussion .
we &apos;re saying people , oh , you don &apos;t have any environmental consciousness in the south .
no , which is throwing is exactly the right thing , yes ?
every place where you throw , from yeah , you create life opportunities .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
as we think about northern .
there &apos;s every footprint in change .
if they walk , yes , each footprint destroys the ground .
because the ground is going to die , and the wind and the water is waking up the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the way .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint that &apos;s going to be a wetland .
not guilt management .
we &apos;re saying in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask them , how about your wife ?
so what do they say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , &quot; heart of individual , &quot; yes ?
that &apos;s the minimum .
so don &apos;t save , trevent , avoid .
every waste is nutrients .
and it &apos;s one of the things when you see in italy , how people in the high bow of the car can take out of the car , for that .
because you know , that &apos;s a full process .
it &apos;s the form of revival behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice cream , which is next temperature in space temperature ?
they can switch them where they go and stand .
in two hours , she &apos;s building everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they throw through biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there &apos;s two cycles .
it &apos;s not all supposed to be compostible .
one television or a washing machine , which you &apos;re using , they don &apos;t use them .
it &apos;s just the things that experience , like shoes , like global engines , like automobiles , they have to be that they &apos;re going into biological systems .
the things that are just used , go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
it &apos;s all direct advertising , not for the company puma , but for you to help this business , make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do the things more free .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to eat and say , that &apos;s free of high , then that &apos;s not helping you anything .
no , we realize what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all what &apos;s inside is useful .
that &apos;s the first shoes that you can put the cavalization on the pedestrial room and go the gumb in biological cycles , right ?
everything is compostible .
and when we &apos;re doing , of course , it &apos;s for adidas , for nike , for hunting and marriage and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half the water problems around the world that &apos;s caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to help with , ask the people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because now they &apos;ve changed twice the chairman .
and i &apos;m not so sure if you &apos;re really going on .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going on .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been represented .
that &apos;s going on .
we can do the things now that if you pick up , if you break , you can go into biological cycles .
technical cycles is exactly the same .
there &apos;s a direct background for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , which is made in going back to the circulation .
so even that , so in each store , you can get things back .
when you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the change ?
when it &apos;s the garbage .
all around them , these transformations are all around .
in the countries , where people come to money .
because it &apos;s on the deponition , but else in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water stores , inside that they can come back to cellulosebuse , then they can plant hundreds of trees with a 
yes ?
if you take these things , you &apos;re going to sterilize it , sterilize and take the polder to plant trees .
this is the baby of carbon for the whole life , already from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need climate neutral , we can be climate .
it &apos;s sort of a beneficial poop .
yeah , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything .
i founded an institute .
there &apos;s a lot of people working on there , and they can all work .
there &apos;s extra one , cradle to-cradle , where everybody can do it .
so not saving , reduce , reduce , reduce , not a glass management , but smart management , but intelligent waste .
does it make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreting .
music as a language .
in the description to my talk , written that i &apos;m as an interpreting , so in the english word , understanding .
interprets are translators of the written notes in sounding music .
that , as a translator , you don &apos;t just translate word for word to a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words and correlation has to understand that there &apos;s a meaningf
from the german , translating into the english , more knowledge can require it , if it &apos;s about power , or about poetry .
but it &apos;s really strange for lain , what we &apos;re doing with music with our music language .
and as an interpreting of a music , i first have the written notes .
you think that the composer has written in the grades exactly everything he &apos;s done .
in reality , the notes are very variety and uncomfortable .
these notes are about the same exact or unlike a verbal , when very seemingly substantially , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape description , the purpose of the flowers don &apos;t say to smell the degree of the green only to recognize the pillars of the wind , not feeling .
that means that the interpreter must translate this incredible state of the note language into another , which is translating hearible , concrete non-verbal music language .
today , i &apos;d like to translate what otherwise i want to translate musically , so interpreting again , translate into a verbal language .
so practically , translation is translation .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to put it on german , because if i had to translate it again in the english , it would be simply translation for me to translate the translation .
so , so the music works for me something like the spoken language .
the notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not enough to read , just learning and pressing the tosts on the piano or the right place on a villanisation .
that &apos;s just the letters you learned to paint .
the letter of the letters don &apos;t recognize when you can do that language .
so for the learning process of music &apos;s learning process of music language as long as for the spoken language .
and then there &apos;s also destructions whether you &apos;re learning for the home use , only passively understands or you can talk to the musical mother &apos;s language .
the work of the interpreting is similar to something like a theater director .
after you &apos;re first looking at a piece of playing because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re only excited about backgrounds of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of secondary .
you read in the letters , diarys , notes , or if there &apos;s words , thoughts about the composers themselves .
you study the works that he &apos;s been composing before and after .
you put comparisons .
the motions of writing it .
how and what did it feel ?
how were his circumstances like the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in .
you think you &apos;re thinking , for example , by looking at contemporary images or literature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also known as an interpret about the composers you &apos;re playing more and easier to think and feel easier to think and feel easier .
the composer is becoming more and more to the friend that you &apos;re living with .
his cause to write the piece , it &apos;s going to get more and more to my personal consequence to play it .
now , now , the notes is an exact record of the component of the composer , but only one scaffold , i &apos;m going to take that framework to fill it back with meaning and meaning .
i then say with my own words , which might be written between this framework .
i &apos;m explaining what these sounds could have .
now for me , and for the composers at the time , and what you could mean for him today .
every song , every phrase is going to get a sense because i feel it myself because it &apos;s now personally lived .
it has to be in here and now , otherwise , i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i can have the experience , the piece that i was working on as long as i &apos;ve been working on in the reason to experience like new .
how to experience a happy new day again , even though always with the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , going to work , i always get the same piece over and over again .
i &apos;ve become older that the seasons , my pulse goes slower than the morning , in a concertral , it takes longer that the sound comes back than at home .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
all of that affects me and all this influences my experience with the composition .
and wonderfully , if i stand with a duo partner on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , enormous conversation .
you bring a new idea , and it &apos;s going to be an answer with a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we didn &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t sample .
it makes big fun to make music in this way , and then the audience has experienced how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play anymore like that .
i can &apos;t play as play like 20 years now .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why my palettes of the music sounds have much more colorances in emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to go out some colors , but to get new ones for that .
have a nice concrete example .
it was on a piano cussion with my loved old teachers , professor young and , a famous beethoven specialist , concert pianist and long-term professor of music school here in studgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young so that he was already when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune to meet him with about 13 years , and so i was at my school , i was on his classes .
i was 17 , when i was participating on one of his classes , and i played the last one of the four ballads of chopin , one lap .
he asked me what was the introduction of these ballads for me .
that &apos;s kind of a curious part .
and in my youth , i said expectation .
that &apos;s where he did , and he said , &quot;
that has to be the ancient difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already six .
well , with you , you have dreams of dreams , but not meaningful memories .
i &apos;m going to play the piece of every few years today , and always transformed it for me , although not a single note changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example of this from a very different area . monet has painted the seasors .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different days of day , in different lights .
he translated the seasons as he saw them , just like you &apos;ve seen in that moment on him .
his personal impressions of the sea .
the six-mile interpretation of a piece is comparable .
by now , i &apos;m already as a chopin with two-three-years ago when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s only lived nine years .
and i &apos;m important to look again and over again , even though i mean they can memorize them .
to keep this direction , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about as long as the spoken language .
often , the music class is that you &apos;re just learning to read the grades .
you learn practically first things before you &apos;re just talking a word .
you learn to find the sounds to the notes on the instrument .
when all the finger in time , and right as it &apos;s in the notes , then they come out , then they come together like music .
when the mistake happens , the student gets the next piece of the student .
the interpretation is barely talking about in the beginning class .
all right , there &apos;s the front presto , which is a quick piece .
lento , slow .
loud and silky , and and b , et cetera .
that &apos;s what most people here .
but even though you &apos;re doing these tasks , there &apos;s still a little bit of technical .
and yet , it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very elemental .
which is , to make music on the instrument , you should do their own musical and feel before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child that didn &apos;t learn the singing because the parents didn &apos;t have , it &apos;s not going to do it .
that &apos;s like speaking learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and idea of the music to bring it across another opportunity to bring an instrument to sound .
people who have never sensed , they &apos;ve never felt their own body , as it &apos;s like to form a tone .
designing a phrase with his own breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
our voices to sing , our hands and feet dancing .
that &apos;s what my fingers in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the melody creates from the singer and the rhythm from the dance .
the continuous resource today with music is not prospering .
you don &apos;t need to make music if it &apos;s going to be bored .
no longer needs to whistle or singing .
every own music is going to be sitting when you &apos;re going to be something from the outside with music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i ask , can &apos;t you sing , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or because they didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
it &apos;s not too late to start with it , to figure out whether they can &apos;t do , or learning how to use these little muscles that are using the vocal things , right .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve decided that they &apos;re uncomfortable .
and then i ask , how competent was this diagnosis ?
did you get a second or third , as you &apos;re going to say it today ?
or , you don &apos;t like music , and that &apos;s why they want to do with it .
but what i was going to regret , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can still convince them .
well , so you see , in all cases , nobody needs to be an unlikely candidate .
but they don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
there i answer , but certainly you can tell if they like them or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook .
so , they &apos;re not doing to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get into classical music because they don &apos;t play any instrument .
listen and say if you taste them or not .
whether the music is performing or sweet .
tell what they feel .
over time , they also get the distinction , and they want to get a little bit more right in there or tastes , even fine differences .
why am i going to ask from my audience that it &apos;s also listening from my audience ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
a work that you &apos;re never looking at has no force .
the food that &apos;s been cooked by a chef or a cook , has to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes .
so , please listen to when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound tapent .
if in an environment , where the adults are doing or at least active music , grows up a child , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a memory , instead of a blue flower .
and that sounds very different than before .
and that was the first stage of a own musical expression .
so the first step is an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which has been written by hundred , two hundreds ago , 2wo hundred years ago , by three hundred years ago ?
the instruments have developed .
there was no piano back at the time .
it wasn &apos;t yet invented .
i think that the beach would have been excited when he had the sound possibilities of today &apos;s modern cianos .
i can think of the sounds that the beach has had on modern wings to sound what a barcoke can &apos;t do .
and even by beethoven , he heard more than he had become dust .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything an orchestra from that than unplannable .
that &apos;s why the composers are dependent on us interprets that reinvent the pieces .
so they &apos;re hearing about what you &apos;ve just considered in the mind .
and also , what you &apos;d think about today in the mind .
or what i imagine today because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s never ?
have you ever been neilly ?
and how did this feel like ?
shoot .
i have a friend who drives a passeration .
and when i come , with my little v piece and myself , it &apos;s going to come up with this feeling .
i shoot something through your head .
i say , &quot; well , what do you need this big car ?
that &apos;s already lost half the value in the first year .
and at all , you &apos;re working a lot less than i work .
why do i have to do something like this ?
and then immediately falls me immediately , that &apos;s just .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i &apos;m saying the word justice is this uncomfortable feeling .
our organism has invented a great way of bringing these uncomfortable feelings like neight to get them to disappear .
and you can try that with words like race or profession , or something like this .
i want to explain something today with this mechanism today , which is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism is from lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lies , as you may have heard , when people say , nobody has to build the wall .
and then stones up , so that he &apos;s going to lose them .
on such lie , you &apos;ll see that the liars doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check that he &apos;s got entirely different .
he just dises them and not yourself .
no , the lies that i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with them to deliver themselves .
they need these lies to get a life life to get a self-deception .
they can bring them less , yeah , testing , or get their pollution .
you need time .
from that time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter pablo picasso has once portraited a woman .
this woman has complained , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see you .
picasso : they only wait .
it &apos;s always getting similar to you .
at this point , and when you laugh , you recognize how important these lies is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a disrupted relationship to lie .
the artist divides something , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if it just looks in the mirror .
the artist divides something like that in a portrait like this , which you &apos;re first going to be familiar when you look at this work over and over again .
and then this uncomfortable feeling couldn &apos;t see it , and it &apos;s going to be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use lies as a great invention of the stabilitation of our lives .
and not just in the art , even in the people in mythology , in stories , it &apos;s going up .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked in the mirror and asked him , who is because the most beautiful in the whole country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful thing .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility out of this true field , even the mirror can &apos;t lie from this real experience .
but we should just be familiar with that you can &apos;t say a woman that there &apos;s a beautiful somewhere else .
here &apos;s needed to understand what we understand under political y correctess .
we need this lie in this place that &apos;s using us the deception without which we can &apos;t live in .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the power poem , but in science , these great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of the worcester .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the department of the people .
that the human should be driving away from monkeys , and yeah , at least a common ancestor , there were between people and monkeys .
and then she ran she ran them her husband , and she said , that &apos;s not true what charles writes there .
the human is going to get off the monkey or have a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people get knowledge of it .
why do we have to prevent that people know about something , if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these life .
because we &apos;re this self-deception , that feeling of being great , the great things about the highest creatures , not by one of these natural levels , like an organism that exists still compara
so , we can &apos;t get these things .
we need to prevent that people get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism resolves and how the traces look like , which he leaves on something else than this great image of ourselves , i want to get you another story .
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife tells me .
she came from school , she &apos;s teacher , and she told you about a student .
an autistic student .
she likes to like to have it particularly because he has an opportunity to history .
and she asked him , what are your hobbys ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m with the fireman .
and because i &apos;m interested in the fire , i &apos;m interested in physical things .
yeah , you feel it , if you &apos;re header at this point . there &apos;s something that &apos;s true .
i &apos;ve said to my wife , whenever a human in a moral justice would use the words because we should try and replace it through the words .
they do that , and then they experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrotechnical things .
they feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the experience .
it &apos;s a little bub who doesn &apos;t interest in fire .
it &apos;s interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no point where we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fireman .
he &apos;s signed up .
and everything , you don &apos;t tell his teacher that you like to put somewhere somewhere , and you &apos;re pleased when the fire is uploaded .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re continuously to consider the dangers that others are creating when they &apos;re putting fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and that providence that , at the besinning of the bub already knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the monscious that immediately gets to do something and the things that you know that they look very differently , so that they can be much bett
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to emerge in the language of the politically correct speaking to the language of the politically correct .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know when we talk that , the social relationships are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
i &apos;m going to give you what we &apos;ve found out in my institute .
after what logic is this deception , this self-depense , the willingness , another reality than the ones that we actually already know that it &apos;s good to spread outside .
here , i want to present two , perhaps three examples .
the first example is predicting what many of you know , and some of you estimates , very little at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something like that , says about leificine .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not by stop , material nature .
and when you have people who are the final beliefs that they have a soul , or you can tell that they &apos;ve been grown from the soul to life , then that &apos;s just like the soul sort of sort of 
and from that soul , you think that somehow in this cloudy nature , in this funny nature , anima is called it in the latin , the air skin , present .
and when this air came across human beings , he &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , yes left with soul .
and then he &apos;s going to get away from it .
that &apos;s what the soul is doing .
so it &apos;s going to get from the outside to people .
so we should perceive them as something that &apos;s necessarily to be present for our lives .
and when you have this assumption of the eyes , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky to experience that through a lie through a lie that we can improve our world .
because now they can apply a trip .
they &apos;re still known from the school .
now this is a district that describes us a logic .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness .
and that &apos;s what you can just apply that logic .
there &apos;s three sentences in that three .
the first sentence is class , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is when claw has right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was participating him in this particular .
a third sentence that &apos;s immediately emerging in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say , who has no soul , which is dead , and you can &apos;t argue .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic on this , yeah , in this decepting talk to express .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
because i can argue everything .
the logic makes no statements about reality .
i can say the man &apos;s a man .
and when i &apos;m right , the driver is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the denter is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about what &apos;s going .
i can claim everything .
but the important thing is , if i have right , there is .
so when class says there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our deceining consciousness immediately feels like this , you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and prevented .
because actually , we need to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which is simply using that two sentences are logically correctly , and a third thing that looks like he &apos;s something to do with it , so we can save our lives .
so , we &apos;re doing as if it &apos;s actually impossible without living a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a whole modern example that &apos;s filling over and over again .
here you have to have another philosophical subject , a broken borner from philosophy , presents .
that &apos;s what we go back into the 10th century .
there was a scholar who was called johannes buridanus , and after that &apos;s the buridan essel .
the buirdian enel is an esland that &apos;s made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
it &apos;s such a nature .
and if you place the exact in the middle between two same size , then he starves .
because he doesn &apos;t know which one should go first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how the nature &apos;s introduced .
the simple forces of opposing projectors solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only when you get another example , so if it immediately makes you bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason , and nothing about it .
automatically he goes to the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of driven in nature , somehow , from the larger piles that attract you immediately , they also have the feeling that there must be something like a free 
and if we &apos;re also here in france at main , i remember the max planck institute for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholar that &apos;s called the wolf singer , and from him sometimes , sometimes they &apos;re saying wolf singer , there &apos;s no willing .
now , we can form the second sentence , and can tell when wolf singer right , he doesn &apos;t have any will freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read almost every day in the day newspaper , that &apos;s what you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like this , who can &apos;t have a willingness , it can &apos;t be moved for his actions and claims to the responsibility , and it &apos;s incredible capable .
again , they have it again .
actually , you &apos;ve got to prove that if there &apos;s something like willing .
but the logic of deception is allowing us to do this , as if the first sentence of the first situation is wrong , that you would have to take the opposite of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can simply want to do something , if you want to test something , and especially when you want to test people happy , that courage to lie .
for example , if you meet a person that you can say , there &apos;s no predictors .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predictors , which is prophet .
you can &apos;t call them , that would be a little bit of politically incorrectly .
tell , there are no predators .
immediately , they &apos;re going to experience one that there are these predictors that you can &apos;t prove .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because as they &apos;re interested with it , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predictors , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about because he did it .
because he led them on a drive where he doesn &apos;t have himself .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s only interested in having to prove themselves before the need to prove that there are predictors .
so , in the kind of shifting of the evidence , they experience the great lie .
and once again , if you have an opportunity to feel that thing in other people , they do , because they &apos;re going to make others happy when they don &apos;t remember them in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to ask her if i can mention it .
and she &apos;s one of the reasons here from this great event , and i asked me if i was going to have a talk and give my idea here .
i &apos;ve got to say it honest , you &apos;ve mitched it , it was difficult for me to talk about my idea .
and i mean , maybe imagine my island project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , of course , is a lot of ideas .
i &apos;m likely to belong , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably going on the generation that would have for this bad ecol image , because i started studying engineering graduate
and i &apos;ve been suggesting in the middle of the 80s , because i wanted to make renewables , and there was no career room .
there was the core research plant .
they meant all the fea at the time , even the just called the cop .
they &apos;re called projects today .
because a good engineer has either great cars or nuclear plants .
but something like &quot; solar point , &quot; from which is kind of a hundred watts of the square feet out , and that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful that he &apos;s retailed the word again because after the wall , you wouldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything was bad .
however , that wasn &apos;t like that in the age 18 .
and there was something that there was self-assembled alternative anternatives , and one of them was sitting in cruscerium in the more time , where you suspected the evil .
and this was called the terrorism , but that was called well-tronic and has made solar energy , and i started in the middle of the 80s .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said today , me very touches me , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve lived through .
i &apos;ve been working on 11 years in the collective , that was basis democratic .
we were 20 people .
when one has said , the vettoprinciple was completely dropped , and i &apos;ve been discovering 10 years because all the colleagues of my father have always wasted , because all the colleagues of my
it &apos;s engaging with growing .
and that was really , really , very bitters , and you &apos;re going to come into that one phase , and that was a picture where i asked me after 10 years , thousands of mark , that &apos;s whether t
and i &apos;ve held it up to six times , and then with friends , we &apos;ve become the companiers of the company that then becomes one of the greatest cell manufacturers in the world .
it &apos;s a huge success story , but also , of course , the problem of growing businesses , and we &apos;ve got two thousands , a small group , decided that we &apos;re starting to start , which is
and that &apos;s where i brought you a project that i want to think about now .
and the title of the talk was , yeah , as you come to hundred percent renewables .
and we &apos;ve just started to ask with a relatively simple crazy story , where would you actually use a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of graciose on the acors .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have a renewable energy community of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
it &apos;s just not technologically .
if you build each other more wind each other , the system is starting to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians when you &apos;re going in berlin aleleshow .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
and can &apos;t be a problem .
but doesn &apos;t , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent percent , we have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , calculating that was two thousands , in the first contacts started with the island , just take the calculation .
how big because you have to be a battery so you &apos;ve got an island of 30 , 30 , 10 , 50 , perhaps even seventy percent renewables .
and , yeah , i &apos;m going to go on a slide .
the conventional system looks like this around the world .
by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electric performance are built in the world .
that &apos;s especially a hundred nuclear power plants , because that &apos;s especially quickly everywhere .
the energy hunter of the world that &apos;s happening is being deleted with diesel , because you don &apos;t need any permission .
that &apos;s quick .
you put that one &apos;s box .
and then it looks like this .
in that , three of the diseases are always waiting for three of these , two will always wait .
yeah , this looks like that down there is the read .
we &apos;ve also got very precise data .
and the winds of solar , or whatever it is , in the rule , a back up system relates to a system that can only mix here in small quantities .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the dial is becoming back-up , and the winds , suns are supplying the load that they can draw the larger share .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then they have to turn the diale .
that means that the moment you &apos;ve got to worry about this , that the renewables sort of can take over the entire web .
and of course , you can only be if they &apos;re managed in some ways .
that didn &apos;t have anyone in the world .
that &apos;s in the little style , so you can also serve your raisers about a little intervention .
people are always asking me , what do you research because you actually ask me ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to switch several of these interactions , and they should build a web , that &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 10 percent renewables , and then there &apos;s this rest , the final rest , the last 10 , 10 percent renewable , which is going to work very , very expensive ,
that &apos;s going to be an energy carrier , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas you know , or six , that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be .
then you have to go more on a seasonal memory and winter summer , and not just day night .
we just wanted to know what is because with a normal , stinning electrochemical battery .
how far are you going to get ?
and then put a whole lot of simulations .
and then wind and sun and came through the result , and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome that you need a middle electricity of about 50 years per kilowatt hour , about five cents per
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the dial system when the display prize is going up in five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulans .
what would everything have to be done ?
it &apos;s negotiated with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new societies .
we &apos;ve been only five people to build one to rebuild the society .
and here again , the representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our systems also has an increase , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to make 20 percent with diseases and don &apos;t suggest through the other things .
and the power utility , which is the electricity of the electricity on the island , has meant that we find great .
we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall , in berlin , where we &apos;re sort of , the electric relationships of the island of one can train one to three really exactly exactly .
that means we &apos;ve first looking for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the fall of japan .
and funny , it &apos;s in the &apos; 30s at bbc &apos;s hunger , and today &apos;s been developed , and then became an acculated to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she &apos;s got a megawatt performance , and it can bring this performance long , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve simulated simulation .
and then they did .
we also have one of these dieling aggregates in the same size , as he &apos;s there , brought into the hall to actually see the complete dynamic behavior of this net , so in the back , it &apos;s th
over here , we simulate the whole transmission system , which kilometer physics of the cables to train the vibrational behavior .
and here you can see again .
we can turn two hundred kilowatts of the web .
here we &apos;re looking at this again , we &apos;re going to see this disease , again , here &apos;s all the single aggregates .
and what we &apos;ve done , since two thousands , then the hall been done , until two thousands of students today , everything that was between the individual system of electronics to develop softwa
so we &apos;re not a battery manufacturer , but we define as a company that &apos;s just between the theme of battery and the theme of the network and everything between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is , you know , on this island , you can basically take the problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this entire discussion , what &apos;s going on at the moment and moving , energy , how to do that , for example , we &apos;ve got the wind , for example , we have the wind and the sun .
of course , smart gridd is offering .
so smart grid , a giant topic everywhere .
we can begin to integrate electromobility , and we can start asking , you can manage the load .
that means when you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you won &apos;t do this without memory .
you can do through the smart grid , you can build through the nets , yes , that &apos;s what you should do , but you &apos;ll never be able to get on memory .
and that &apos;s what the message is .
so a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn that down , you don &apos;t have this rotating mass that causes a certain kind of weight on the net .
and our european connectivity is basically from louder rotating masses of great power plants , wherever the waves are all around europe .
we &apos;re looking into this net , the fifty heart , and when it &apos;s going to get nine of the command nine heart , we &apos;re starting to make a few valves , and then we go back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly wearing .
if you travel that somewhere , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
the spinning reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net .
and in the time , they can respond to others .
if you don &apos;t have that , this rotating mass , then you have to replace that with performance electronics and electrochemistry .
and we can switch with this big battery two milliseconds once .
that &apos;s where you see what enormous speed opportunities there are .
and the message is , we need to get to these rotating masses , if we kind of get our goals of 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 percent and so on , if we want to reach them at all .
and then we have to develop our puttin runs of the net .
mustarn run is simple , the power station runs with to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a big debate right now , building from the coal power stations , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gasterbines , because that &apos;s not going .
and we &apos;re just trying to deal with the capacity that the mustern runs of capacity , can build , by bringing electrochemical memories on the net .
there &apos;s happily now a lot of studies .
and at that purpose , people come along and look at our experience on the united states , our intelligence of our island .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can take a piece of far future .
and many discussions that i had over the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had over the past 30 years , to the subject of photovoltaics .
it &apos;s not going , it &apos;s awful , children , we &apos;ve calculated everything , never calculates .
we have 30 gigawatt photovoltaics in germany .
that &apos;s productive .
and i just go out that we &apos;ll have the same capacity on electrochemicals around the world .
very simple , that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to come .
there will be such a whole bunch of resistances and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve experienced just in the last two years , that the scientists have on my side .
we have now getting over 10 million focus projects , also about ten megawatt battery now to german web .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so from therefore you &apos;re also noticing that there &apos;s a change there , and only from that distriction to yes , to the idea of hundred percent renewables .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , that &apos;s like an author system .
so far , in discussions are always trying to do these insulans , who are doing authark , they have a sittle net , which has nothing to do with our connection .
the question is very easy , if you &apos;re completely independently doing any fossil or uranian energy consumptions that are brought out somewhere in the world and brought into them , then they &ap
then they &apos;re just going to use what &apos;s on the sun and wind is there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision from a sensitive energy supply , and i &apos;m also gratef to cradle that they said , use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and informers come , also the talk of premime kola , that you can be a collective and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you in the sense that you can be quiet a little crazy and also have a vision .
and you have to remain pretty much , but i think that &apos;s going on .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day through the streets at the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african american , sympathic , room , homeless , who was only two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because from steve &apos;s articles became a book that was students with robert dowwey juniur as steve lopez and jamie anthony aers , the contrast that stud
nathaniel left julilaria , and 30 years later , he lived as a homelesser on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
i &apos;m going to recommend to read the steve book or looking at the movie , so that you &apos;re not only going to understand the wonderful connection that &apos;s helped between these two men , b
i met my ager in 2008 , about two years ago , in the walt disney concert hall .
he &apos;d just heard a demonstration of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he talked about in a very harder and social tone over yo-yo and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never be able to create the baseball series , and all because of the public passage of the f
we came up with music , and a couple of days later , i got an email that nathanell was interested in mine with me .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathanel has rejected a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric shocks and with theorazine and hands through , a trauma that has followed his 
and as a consequence of this , he &apos;s particularly susceptible for these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of skid row , always goes ar
and in the same way , nathaniel , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in the warld disney concert hall , and he had lost this iron flacker in his eyes and worked .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how somebody wanted to poison it .
i was afraid , not mine , but i was fear that i could lose it into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the times when i started talking about transmitters and advergious
so i started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violincorter .
and while i was playing , i realized that in nathanies &apos;s eyes went a complete change .
it was as if he stood under the influence of an invisible drug , a chemical response that catalytor was my game .
nathaniel &apos;s manic larner transformed in understanding , into a quiet curiosity and power .
and as through a miracle , he took his hends and started playing a couple of clips of violin concerts , and then asked me to end them to end : mennels son , trahikovski , sibelium .
and we then started talking about music , started by back over beethoven , brahn , braunders and all the other boss , from bartoo to esasa keka salones .
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopedia knowledge about music , but he was also connected to a personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i only know my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
by playing music , and music talked about music , was from this paranoid , confused man who was moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , educated , excellent musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means seal health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something .
and that &apos;s how he enters his policient states .
i understood that that &apos;s the creature of the art .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing music : so we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s in all of us , deep inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens through our creativity of reality .
and the reality of that expression is going to all of us , and moves , inspired and unites us .
what nathaniel went , so it brought him back into a community of friends .
the providing force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him that his talent and looked at him .
and i &apos;m going to mush music with nathaniel , whether in the warld disney concert hall , or skid row , because it reminds me of why i &apos;ve become musicians .
thank you .
bruno gissani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve unclearly stolen the cellisters .
i hope you &apos;re making me .
so i know a lot of fishes in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , wonderfully , good consistency , salary , a besteller on the mine .
what a fish .
even better , it was broken in aquaculture after the sustainable standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
and one day , the ceo of the company called and asked if i could talk at an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve , which has become this unimaginable problem for our chefs , how do we keep fishing on our mines ?
over the last 50 years , we fished the ocean as we have beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tunas , the helicopte , the laugh , sword fish , they &apos;re broken .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so probably , or over aquaculture , fishing , a part of our future .
many arguments about it . fishing statements pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a great disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a food restoration of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish are needed so you get a pound of tuna .
not very sustainable .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to support them .
and on the day before the event , i called the people of public work for the company .
let &apos;s call it him .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building so far outside in the ocean that you don &apos;t pollute the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish distributes , not focused . &quot;
and then he asked , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this food restoration of 2.5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , short before the event , done .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i &apos;ve been telephone with some people in the company , nobody could give me an answer , until i finally phone telephone with the sufficient biologists .
let &apos;s call him done .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algaes and some fisheries , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , bone , bone , braked and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of perhaps two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainable to feed chickens of fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chickens in the world . &quot;
i entered myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-esseed engineer and good number .
i &apos;m actually .
no , i &apos;ve actually moved out of this fish , because , i &apos;m swearing at god who tasted after this entertainment for chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , where you get better you learn your fish , you love the fish the more .
i &apos;ve eaten him first in a restaurant in south spain .
one friend journalist had spoken for a long time from this fish .
it &apos;s been doubling us in a way .
he came on the table with a bright , almost blaming white color .
the chef had considered him .
take twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste a fish so well after he &apos;s been connected ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it miguel . it &apos;s actually michule .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way you understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta palma .
this is a fishing up in the southwestern corner spain .
it &apos;s near the river of ghe gualaqivique .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
they were growing fleshers on what were basically wetlands .
they did that by determining the country .
they built this complicated result of channels , and they put water from the country , and they put it in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economic .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for these places .
and in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country in 1982 .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve reversed the flow of the water .
they &apos;ve literally surrounded the lever .
instead of thinking out the water , they used the channels to pull the water again .
they flooded the channels .
they created a 11,000 hectare -- barsh , the mean , shrinnel , al -- and his company has completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare out in the horizon that &apos;s one million miles away , and everything you see are flooded channels and this density , body march .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part , &quot; a crocodile to the kisses . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fighted us through the wetlands , and i &apos;m sweating , and sweats , has mate to my knees , and miguel holds a biological lecture .
here &apos;s a rare glitary here .
now , he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here he sees a pattern of conditions that reminds him to the tanzanian giraffes .
it turns out that might has spent most of his career in the michu of national park in africa .
i asked him what he &apos;s become a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and it goes into more speaking of rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the biotical community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak across this connected piece of delicious fish that i had on the outside .
so i interrupted him . i said , &quot; miguul , how does it taste your fish ? &quot;
he showed on the algae .
&quot; i know , young , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eats your fish ?
what &apos;s the food reservation ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-referent .
there &apos;s no food .
ever beyond a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later on the day , i went around with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; unlike every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a film change would have required a stage change .
and we bound around the corner , and we &apos;re going to be the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of pinkers flamingos , literally , pinker &apos;s literally enough .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your book , pink .
they &apos;re going . &quot;
buds ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; migue , don &apos;t think your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes . &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing on the birds .
well last year , on this piece of 600,000 birds , more than 250 different ways .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in all of europe .
i said , &quot; migue , is a great bird was not the last that you want to have on a fishing ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extremely , not intense .
this is an ecological network .
the flaminos are eating the shrimps .
the shrimps eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinkers are the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about it . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures her success at the health of their predators .
fishing , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flaminos of flamings shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away , where the ground note is better for the nest maintenance .
every morning , they fly 200 miles to the farm .
and every night , they fly 200 miles .
they do that because they can follow the striked white line of the land street .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; migue , do you fly 200 kilometers to the farm , and then fly back to the night ?
do that for children ? &quot;
he looked like i &apos;ve just quoted a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like you .
it &apos;s this bunch , cheated taste .
i &apos;m neally cooking with it .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in south spain , she wasn &apos;t tasted at all for fishing .
it tasted sweet and in , as if you would take a bite of the ocean .
i mentioned this to migue , and he did not .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a swim .
it &apos;s the last disease before something &apos;s going on in the body .
she &apos;s developed in the course of evolution to sustain incidences . &quot;
and then he asked , &quot; but our water has no incentives . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures your success at the success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have uncertaints , it &apos;s enormous , because the water that flows through this farm , comes out of the flow of gualaqiquir .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that rivers today tend to lead them with themselves , chemical pollutants , disruption food .
and when it &apos;s fighting through the system , and that leaves the water than how it got in .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a water review , and not just t
because when the water is flowing out , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take him , and that &apos;s what you should do , because that love story , as romantically , is increasing .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good foods whether we &apos;re talking about barch or meat .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one that actually tastes food .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not realists , we &apos;re engineers . we &apos;re lovers .
we love weeks . we love little family environments . we &apos;re talking about regional foods . we &apos;re eating bio .
and if you claim that that &apos;s the things that the future of good foods are insured , somebody somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love pink flaminos , but how are you going to feed the w
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
one billion people are going to hunger today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than than before -- because of crasser inequalities in distribution , not the total production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because she has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grains of plant framers , pesting forces of monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chickens on fish , and all the time has asked the agribustry , &quot; if we feed more people how terrible can
that was the movement . it was the justice . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a commercial in development , a device that contributes quickly ecological capital that enables this production .
it &apos;s not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our grandmother &apos;s threatened today , not because of engaging resources , but because of general resources .
it &apos;s not through the latest power and tractor inventions , but through fertile land , not by pumping , but by fresh water , not by chains , but through forests , and not through fishing and ne
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are able to feed themselves ?
to do that , you don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are standing in it , and it never produced something really good for the food .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going back to two billion years of work experience .
look at miguel , farmers like migual .
operations that aren &apos;t for themselves , which are instead of using , doings that are extensively growing , farmers who are not just more productors , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i &apos;m going to show you a thing today is that the total of the data that we consume , is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information transmission , i want y
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a typical death graph at age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivo , and what i can do with pito is that i can filter after a particular death , we &apos;re saying accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes .
and that &apos;s because in the middle area here , the people are most active , and they &apos;re over here at the most comfortable .
we can go out one step further and put the data then new and see that circular diseases and cancers are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , when we go on and sort after age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are actually the main cause of what people should worry about .
and who &apos;s continuing to research that this is particularly true of men .
so you can see that this is looking at information and data in this way that reminds very significant information graphics in this way .
and if we can make this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
so what we have here are the covers of every single &quot; sports illustrated , &quot; which were ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it after my talk in their rooms .
with pivot , they can dive into a decade .
you can dive in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular experience .
so when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this experience and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;m clicking over here all of me spending all the spendings in which lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i wanted to get a grain overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all with the issue of driving ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going back a step back and extend the perspective .
now i &apos;m going to see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you look for this kind of information , targets , widers , zoom out , zoom , you don &apos;t look for or don &apos;t just look for shelf .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i &apos;d like to continue to do this idea a little further with something that &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia and reduce them to a little summary .
the summary contains a short , and a symbol for the area of it comes from .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the popular wikipedia sites .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an impression of the issues that are the popular on wikipedia .
so i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
now , after selecting the government , i realize that the wikipediactators that are most of the time magazines , &quot; people in the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is an insight that doesn &apos;t have a single wikipedia .
it &apos;s just to recognize when you go back and look at the whole .
looking at a certain of these summaries , i can go to the theme of time magazine &quot; people &apos;s , &quot; and see all together .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of the governments are governments . some of them come from science . some of them , even less , come from the economy . here &apo
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you can see , we &apos;re surfing on the web , the first time it &apos;s really a web , not just by side , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you something else , which could be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pipot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can look at this technology to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step , and i can jump directly to a specific section .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important , because it &apos;s only by looking at websites in this way , the whole internet can look in the same way .
so i can zoom into a particular fame in the course of time .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve been talking about here .
and i can sort of come back anything i &apos;ve been looking back today .
and , if i go back and look again , and for everything , i can record my course after my search , and here , i &apos;ve been looking for &quot; nepotic &quot; here to bing , or here to live lab pivo
and from here , i can go into the site and call them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s going to be used again , and every time it makes the entire picture of the data parts .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a flow .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on your head , so that we &apos;re instead of going from one to the other , are starting to go from many things to many things , and that &a
if we can do that , that &apos;s going to be a new source of data , perhaps a new source of meaningful information .
and , instead of moving only in information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we experience that , then maybe we can actually pull wisdoms from that .
that &apos;s what i hear is , thank you very much .
i grew up with a major portion of science fiction .
i went to school in my school , every day with an hour every day .
and my nose always put in a book , a science-fiction book , which made my thoughts in other worlds , and in a narrative way , my deep in me in me , sitting , interesting curiosity .
and this curiosity showed that if i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , through the forests , collected and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and beetles and bugs and bags , and lo
i was completely excited , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and release the limitations of the possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew the moon and explore the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and a world full of miracles that we could never imagine before .
and that &apos;s pretty good at this science fiction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there was neither video games even this overlooking with computer-generated movies all the time in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we all had to . if we read a book at the time , we took the description of the author and projected them on the canvas in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and painting from alien , extraterrestrial worlds , robots , robots , shapes and all this .
in math class , i became all the time on the teacher , like , i hidden behind the textbook , hidden around .
the creativity had to somehow .
and what happened is something interesting , which was fascinated by jacques cousteau &apos;s shows , the thought of one of us was completely unknown world here on our earth .
certainly , i &apos;d never achieve an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed to me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotically as all of the things i &apos;d always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 to become diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a little village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t really encourage myself .
i took my father until he finally made a dive school in buffalo , new york , finally , exactly on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool of the ymma in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , i got a real ocean , i got face only two years later than we moved to california .
since the 40 years , which are now standing , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under water ; 500 hours of this in smooth .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flather oceans , even in the stranger oceans , as we can really imagine it .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , really , contrast to our own , common imagination .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love of the ocean holds up with the same intensity as eight and ever .
and when i looked at adults as an adult , it was the filmmaking .
this seemed to be the best possibility of telling stories to tell stories to create images .
as a child , i drew computing books and so on .
so the films were the way to put images and stories , and that &apos;s what they were together .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , from the science fiction line : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abjss . &quot;
in &quot; abys &quot; i could make my preference for the underwater and diving with the filmmaking .
so my two passions were going to go .
something interesting happened in &quot; abjss , &quot; to solve a storytelling problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we went to computer-generated animatio
what came out was the first computer-generated soft surface figure that was ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t bring money , exactly he played his production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that went out of it .
arthur clarke &apos;s law are known advanced technology and magic anymore .
so they looked something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that needs to be involved in the film art . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator , &quot; my next film , much more .
together with ilm , we &apos;re creating the guy &apos;s fluid metal , and the success was going on what this effect would get .
and it worked . again , we had created something magic . and the effect in the audiences was the same thing , but we &apos;ve played a little more money with the movie .
from these two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for film .
so i started a company together with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of the best make-up and creature designers . she was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
and the basic idea of this company was to overcome the phase analog processes with optical printers and the same with digital productions .
and then we did then , and we got a competitive advantage .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creature and character design -- which we actually founded the company to slowly .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which should be produced the message of visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new height , with realistic human , expressive cha
but the retail pressed very beautifully , and people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to create that .
so i shifted this and did this other film about the great ship that &apos;s going on .
the film studio i have sold this as &quot; romem and julia on a ship , &quot; and it became a love film of episcs , a passionate movie .
but what i really wanted to do is the real trajectory of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
and i convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to the grack . we &apos;re moving the real truck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it &apos;s hugely important . it &apos;s a good stop for marketing . &quot;
and i came up with them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy , but that &apos;s going to go back to that your imagination can create a reality .
and we actually created six months later , a reality where i related in a russian diversity , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a bulght .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that &apos;s really watching me .
and the preparation was enormous . we needed to build cameras and lights and all sorts of things .
and i felt like how much these deep sea changes would look like a space mission .
well , they were also high-engineering and compressive planning .
you get into this capsule , then you get into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope of rescue if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction film .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the exploration of the deep sea .
anyway , the part that has to do with curiosity and science , and it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal , and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , and for the scienc
so that &apos;s the right thing , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met something unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main profession as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice and becomes full-time researchers . &quot;
and then we started , we did to the bismarck , and they explored them with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the titanic .
we took little robots that we &apos;d built , which were developing a fiberglass cable .
our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship that never had been done before .
nobody had explored the inside of the wrack , you didn &apos;t have any means . so we developed the necessary technology .
well , and so i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a dive boat , and see planks that are pretty similar to these boards here , and once i know that once has played there .
and i fly with a little robot vehicle through the walks of the ship .
i &apos;m actually doing it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the titanic wrock .
this was the most surrealest form of a djx that i &apos;ve ever experienced because before i ever experienced a corner of the vehicle , i would always know what was going on in the line of the vehic
because that was an exact copy of the building plans of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
and she made me this telepresence experience that you &apos;re using such robotic avatars , and you could use their own consciousness into the vehicle , into this other shape of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and perhaps a small look at what might happen in a couple of decades when you have cyborg bodies to explore something or other things , in all kinds of post-humans , that i can imagine myself as a s
and after these expeditions , we started what we &apos;ve seen down there , really estimate , for example , these deep sexuals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s just
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in one sunlight based system as we do .
and this is what you see animals that directly next to a 500 degrees celsius , that they can survive there .
and at the same time , i was very interested in space science , and that was back to the science-fiction influence from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and doing with nasa and sit with nasa , and planning to russia , and then drive to russia , then fly to the international space station 
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took space scientists with us into the deep sea .
and i took them up with and did them access to the world : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources to look around 
we turned documentary films , but actually , it &apos;s actually science , space science .
so the circle between my existence as a science-fiction fan , when as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly now thinking about a director , you have to be a leader like a ship capita or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i got these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;ve just playing the production cost . from free doesn &apos;t .
everybody &apos;s thinking i &apos;d be between titanic and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have run the nails on a beach on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentaries , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
not a fram , no money , what do you do ?
you make it around the job , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that &apos;s going on , and because of the strange connection that comes when a small group of people 
because we &apos;ve only made all of these with only 10 to 12 people who have been unterrupted for years , sometimes we were two to three months to each other .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve made a task that you can &apos;t explain .
when you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound , and the way around , all the technology and the difficulties , the human performance , when you work on
there &apos;s a connection , an each other respect .
so when i got back to turn my next movie &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re respecting your team and deserves in the course of that respect .
so the dynamics was really changed .
so there i stood again with a little team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that we didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
it &apos;s an incredible challenge .
and we &apos;ve become a real family for a four-and a half years .
and it changed my way to make films , completely .
there were people who thought we would have done these oceans really well and transported pandora to the planet .
for me , it was more principle ways to do my job , the actual process that changed in the result .
so what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think the first place is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the direction of your team is more important than all the lobers in the world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a give me how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t get yourself .
that &apos;s another one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , not against themselves , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and in explorition , you have to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a trust .
not an important thing that required innovation , ever would have been done without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks like this .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
i &apos;m talking to you today about energy and climate .
and that surprises something because my full-time attachment in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , the things that we need to invent and deliver the poorest two billion a better lif
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than for the others on the planet .
climate description means that their sates are not growing over many years ; it &apos;s too much or little rains , and things are going to change what their fragile environment can &apos;t hold .
that leads to hundreds . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to cross .
so , it &apos;s going to be a climate change terrible for them .
also , the energy price is very important .
the fact is , if they could only reduce the price , to production would be energy at the most effective .
well , the energy price is like over time .
in fact , progress society is based on energy progress .
the coal revolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity prize , and therefore we have refrigerators , conditioning , we can ma
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s half the price -- we &apos;re making a new barrier , and this barrier depends with co2 .
carbon warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re summing the emergenc co2 that leads to the temperature , and this temperature has some very negative follows . effects on the weather , and maybe worse , the indirect consequences that
well , the exact relationship between a carbon and the resulting temperature change , and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some uncredities , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly uncomfortable about how bad these consequences are going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists , &quot; do we really need to get down to zero ?
doesn &apos;t enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s quite different than saying , we have a three-and-a-half truck that has to be under a three bridge , and that &apos;s when you &apos;re going to squeeze underneath .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , we have a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to produce changes that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constant .
only different economic changes have affected it at all , and we need to go from rapidly to reduce , and a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit multiplication . they have this thing -- co2 -- that you want to get towards zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , the avera
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and let &apos;s think about how we get this to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to be very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
first , we have the population .
today live 6.8 billion people .
and it writes to 9 billion dollars to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the health care and reproduction medicine , we could be about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we see a stop at 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this includes everything , the food that we eat , clothes , television , heat .
these are very good things and poverty reduction means to make these services almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we would probably make a distribution and use less , but on average , that number will go up every year and double the number of services that the per pers
here we see a very basic service . are there an home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school work under the street light .
well , in effectivity , where , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t get up .
because of different successes in the light sector , through new methods , through new methods , there are a lot of services whose energy experienced some single services are reduced by 90 percent .
in other services , like manufacturing fertilizers , 105 , 15 , 55 : 50 , 50 : 50,000 or the air traffic , is the place of improvements is a lot smaller .
in all , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction around a factor three or maybe even a factor 3 .
but with the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion perhaps the very best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to embate per energy .
it turns out the question , whether you can get this to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity is co2 , except the renewables and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonder .
now if i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
normally , there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally , you &apos;re just like that , and some come , others .
but in this case , we have to give pollowing and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really bring this ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that &apos;s going on here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitoes , and somehow people liked this .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , that &apos;s what this is .
i decided that the fireflies would be my this year &apos;s contributions to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you assure you that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they don &apos;t even get to leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all sorts of play solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t do much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have an imaginable scaling and imaginability , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see five who can affor
i &apos;ve left times , geothermal , fusion and biofuels .
these are maybe a modern contribution , and when they do better than i expect , that &apos;s great , but my reason here is that we have to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give us any of 
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , combustion of coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is perhaps seems easy , but that &apos;s not . you have to come up with all the co2 that comes from the chimney that comes out of the chimney , and then hope that it stays there 
there are some pilot projects that create this on a 60 percent percent , but getting it 10 percent , but getting it very difficult for the carbon of the carbon , but the biggest problem here is the 
who &apos;s going to make it ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volumes .
so that &apos;s a hard one .
next , nuclear energy .
it has three big problems . the costs , especially in highly regulated countries are high . the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human employment
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that are perhaps soluble , and that &apos;s where you should work on .
the last three of the five has put together .
it &apos;s the renewables as they &apos;re called .
and they also have -- even though it &apos;s great that they need no fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is the energy density that these technologies create lower than the power stations .
these are energy farms , you talk about a lot of square kilometers , thousands of times more area than a normal power plant .
also , these sources come up with interruption .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the entire day , she doesn &apos;t seem every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t seem to be constantly .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have a way that energy is available in times if it &apos;s not available in times .
so there are big price challenges here . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy of where
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made -- looking at cars , computers , cell phones , pockets , for everything , and that &apos;s what all batteries that we
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 better than the approach to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources about saying 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to support 100 percent on that , you need an incredible beautiful battery .
well , where should we go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project , &quot; how are we going to get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
for many , you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there &apos;s a lot of things that are already engaged .
bill gross has several companies , under other things that has great solar technologies .
vindo kosla invested in dozens of companies that make great things and have interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , follows the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear world ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terrapown concept means you &apos;re instead of one part of the uran , the one percent , which 2330 , we decided to burn that 99 percent , the u.22 .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this , but you could never reasonably simulate whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost profile is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors than an antivitation .
instead of breaking your head , burn it easy . it &apos;s a great thing .
the uranium is going to use gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column as the &quot; moving wave of reactor . &quot;
it really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s whe 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called uranium .
that &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re just filtering ocean water , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our design look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the interdependence .
a lot of talks about an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be created in poor countries , and still some agriculture , and hopefully speech and cement is going to be clean to clean .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , their electricity generation is completely curved .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this detection .
when we go back from there , how should it look like the 2020s ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the efficiency to bring reduction , and the less we emitate , the lower we &apos;re going to be carbon , and that &apos;s what the temperature will be .
but actually , this note for the things that we don &apos;t like businesses that don &apos;t completely lead to the great reductions only , or even a little bit more important as the other things th
these breakthroughs , we have to track with full polls , and we can measure it : in company , in pilot projects and regulation changes .
there are many great books to this subject .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , and david mckays &apos;s &quot; sustainable energy withouth the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through , and they create a framework where this can be discussed because we need support for all sides .
there &apos;s some things that needs to come together .
this is a wish .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you just had a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and that &apos;s what i love , or i could choose that wish , which is , half-based energy price without co2 
this has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that desire , the dig between the long-term and short-term terms are horrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of these 
so what do we need to do ?
and for what kind of things i &apos;m going to do ?
we need to use for more research money .
if countries meet in places like coppensations , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk to this innovation strategy , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , carbon , cap &amp; amp ; dream something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to lead dialogues rational and more complete and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can feel it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand terrapower a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer to get all the great scientists that we did , we just need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make su
the hard step is the building of the first reactor to find other billions , the regularias and the place that is actually building the first of them .
once the first thing is , if the first thing is promised , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic , the energy density is so different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to understand that , which means almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuels , this used uranium , and then the process begins and works down ?
bg : exactly . today you need to research the reactor , so there are a lot of people and many controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and brings things inside , that &apos;s not
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can feel it for 60 years -- think about a column -- that you bury without all the complexities .
and it sits there and burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear reactor that offers a solution to the trash .
bg : yeah . now , what happens with the garbage : you can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn him in the next reactor .
and we start by taking the garbage that exists , which is in these current bags or dry containers in the reactors , and that &apos;s our general fuel .
so that &apos;s what these reactors were a problem , what we &apos;re fulling in our fills , and that will dramatically reduce dramatically during that process .
but while they &apos;ve talked about these possibilities with different possibilities .
where &apos;s the biggest interest to do so what ?
bg : now , we didn &apos;t set us in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting regulations for everything the number &apos;s &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interests an
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese made something in the direction .
this is a variant of something that &apos;s been done .
it &apos;s an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built them , so everybody who has made a quick reactor , a candidate for our first .
in your imagination : time frame and probability of calling something like this ?
bg : well , we need one of these scalable , electricity things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then 20 years .
this is like the deadline , which has shown us the environmental models that we need to hold .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything is going on , and that &apos;s a great wish , that could be easy .
and fortunately , today , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , who , exactly , when their approaches work , the foreign for their pilots work for them .
and it would be best when they &apos;re multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the biggest possible breakthroughs is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important .
it would have been it without the environmental challenge , but that makes it so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know what their work is not as good as these , but there &apos;s the modular way , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactortype that seems something difficult , but maybe they &apos;re telling that about us .
and so there are different things , but the beautiful thing is that an uran molecule has a million times as much energy like it , we say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the 
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to introduce emergency techniques to try to keep the earth &apos;s perature stable ?
bg : when you get to that situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve eaten too much , and it &apos;s short of a heart attack , what do you do ? you may need a heart peration or similar .
there &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geongenering , which is dealing with different techniques to deliver the warming so that we would get 20 or 30 years to build us together .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working on the insurance because you may not make you make it fall , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart curation .
i don &apos;t know if you lead the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discour in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things come faster , if things come faster ,
climate scientists : do you have one or two sentences for you maybe to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that shift with the clouds that shift things ?
there are very , very few things that you can say at all , of which there is an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is similar as aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay that much later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is now , if you have all kinds of pressing problems , invest in something that you have later -- and the investment isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and the
the fact is that this insecurity should be worried about .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos
and that would be her answer to the born lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals are doing waste of malaria , the money that there is
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year than they do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
under that , other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you get too much money , and there &apos;s reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to finance that , and for me , most of the waste is happening .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short from a cost , and it &apos;s only the learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be a lot more cheaper .
if the abstract that you get , it &apos;s a very high energy prize , then you can only continue .
i mean , each of us could spend five times as much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new make is now , &quot; why doesn &apos;t the research don &apos;t talk anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still associated because of his earlier stories , associated with the skeptic camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to bring th
and that &apos;s a thought that i think for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that &apos;s going to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman was a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is quite easy . four teams have to build the largest possible structure with 20 spaghetti , and about two of the tape , about the distance and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be on the top .
and even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually really difficult , because it &apos;s people to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i did about 70 workshops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with cots of the fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something on this task , which enables
normally , most people start to orient themselves about the task .
they &apos;re talking about how it &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re running around .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they &apos;re sicking and put spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the collectively growing structures .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow and they put it down to the top , step back and &quot; ta da &quot; !
but what then , almost always happened that the &quot; ta-da &quot; becomes an &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow , the weight of the marshmallow does , that the whole thing
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; ul-oh ok &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh web absolutes .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and producing really quiet shapes .
and of course there are teams that have much more &quot; ta da &quot; shapes and underneath the best are fresh fresh from kindergarten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
like us peter , they &apos;re not only producing the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might wonder is : how does that come ? why ? what about them ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the children invests in the case of being the spaghetti gmbb . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that blu students have been trained to find a real plan , ok ?
and then realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kindergarten kids are different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshallow on the top , that they have sustainable to repa
constructures recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of an ideative process .
and with each attempt , the children get immediately feedback , which works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , essentially -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of them is at about 80ch , blad students create half of them , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
it &apos;s the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-enhancing geometrical patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are something about average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
you put an excustive administrator on the team , you &apos;ll significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . they look around and recognize &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict the prediction . why is that ?
because they have particular skills of process .
they lead the process , they understand .
and that team that regulates and on the work , the performance of the team is significant .
specialized skills and process and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , they get about six , the stable structures .
i tried something exciting .
and i thought , we &apos;re going to get the poker approach .
so i &apos;m offering a 1,000 police prizes in software for the winners .
what does it happen with these design students ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if somebody &apos;s built a two-fiect construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it &apos;s not interesting that high competitions have a strong effect .
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been from the same , bad team one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
there are profound lessons for us about nature of drive and success .
you may ask , why would somebody actually invest in a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason is i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams to help cars , video games and &quot; visual effects . &quot;
and what the marshmallow challenge is doing , it helps them identify hidden assumptions .
because open , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who &apos;re interested in can visit marshmallow .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a step for step there .
they find crazy examples from around the world how people optimize the system and refine .
there &apos;s also world record .
and the basal lesson , i think , the construction is actually a connective sport .
it demands that we all are using our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , how our feelings and our doings , which is before us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything it takes to bring us from an &quot; ul-oh , &quot; -- to bring it to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
and that can do a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s have a machine here .
a large machine , a cool , tedtal machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; they can &apos;t stay in there and now .
and i wonder what they were going to choose , because i asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to back in time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;ve done down to nostalgia , to thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurer .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that there were ever on the planet , no matter which scale they put , health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , disease rates .
there was never before a time like this .
my grandparents died everybody when they were 60 .
my grandparents put this number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the features .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid who &apos;s born in new delhi today can expect to live like the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox killed billions of people on the planet .
they have reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re away . they &apos;re disappeared .
we &apos;ve forced them . how .
in the rich world , diseases , the millions of us have still threatened by a generation , hardly .
dippetries , rotes , child paralysis ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific way of trying things , look , whether it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were mentioned .
and one of them is that , despite all of our achievements , a billion people on the world are going hungry to bed every day .
this number is going up , and it &apos;s going very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to destroy this world .
drinking , forest country , rainforests , oil gas , they disappear , and if we didn &apos;t get out of this chaos , and we &apos;re not going to go out of this chaos .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce foods that will feed billions of people without the country they live .
i think we can provide this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a wish .
but this stops me night -- one of the things that hold me at night -- we haven &apos;t needed scientific advances like now , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it reasonable as we can .
we &apos;re on the threshold to astonishing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really need to go back hundreds of 300 years ago to find a time where we fought about progress in which we have
people hell in their beliefs , and that &apos;s so close that you can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth , it &apos;s going to liberate .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a right to his opinion to progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have any right to their own facts . &quot; sorry , they didn &apos;t .
and i needed a while to find out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorkers , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to get resistance , resistance to what at the end , is the most effective thing in the health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and drove .
and soon i wrote an article about genetically changing food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; frankfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a particular random that was an
but you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we &apos;re typing , we &apos;re enjoying , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles worried me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that didn &apos;t make me crazy at all .
these were important people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that &apos;s what took me to each other ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to the progress , like earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about it , with little leaderships about it , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes into the science , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the challengers , vixox , mass destruction , the u.s. presidential elections .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they &apos;re always right . so be skeptical .
imagine asking , demand the evidence , demand them .
don &apos;t take anything than given .
but now , if you get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can say that , that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of the fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the autism epidemic with the masser , mum , and rotal vaccine brought into connection .
very frightening .
bunch of the studies were done to see if that &apos;s wrong .
common studies should be done , that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all equal , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see to see what do we feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents from a government that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of that fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine for makers .
that &apos;s scandallo , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because somebody has somebody here ?
does a single person in the audience are seeing somebody in masers ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
happens in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world in the last year .
this is a lot of death through masers , 20 percent hour .
but because it &apos;s not happening here , we can draw it , and people like jenny mccrathy can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never , are the same .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst mistakes of humanity .
no fear , no jellyfish , paddy , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it &apos;s called paul offite .
he &apos;s just developing a rotavurus vaccine with some other people .
he can save the lives of 400 , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul walks around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop getting up .
and that &apos;s actually saying that .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks about a public sustainable , he can &apos;t tell without armed guards .
he gets calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are incredible .
you take them out , you go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have now in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon , children are going to die again , because that &apos;s just a question of the numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masers .
what about child policy ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a commiliton of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and she said she believed i &apos;m a little bit too school .
no one has told that ever before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against challenging , no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a chald paralysis , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a child paralysis in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in the lagos morning and flying to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and rented a car , and he gets to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s infected with a paralyzisease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
that &apos;s the planet that we &apos;re living . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to get us in lies . we love that .
did you take all your vitamins today ?
echinacea , a little anti-oxidence that &apos;s helping you on the jump .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half the americans make that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cures , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly .
they &apos;re doing their u.ine . more does it almost never .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to completely agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i &apos;m understanding -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate one too much government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely cold and self-rising themselves to us who can afford it .
so we &apos;re walking away from that , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re walking in the poor of the placebo industry .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , this is really a serious business because the stuff is mixed , and we &apos;ll give billions of dollars .
and i have all sorts of little repuisitions here .
none of them -- gingko , cheat , echanaca , came , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s , but we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s concrete .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream and say , &quot; what cares you ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health minister who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some cancer jack that
if you give yourself on that path where belief and magic and science , they get to a place where they want to be .
they got to the toabh mbei in south africa .
he brought 800,000 people because he instituted that red bees , bonal and nuclear one are much more effective than antiretrovirals that we know that they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country which is worse than any other one of that disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have .
well , the most brillist epidemic that we &apos;re in is this absolute struggle between the workers genetically changed food and biolite .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every rice , every branch of petersie , every rose cool , was changed by the people .
you know , there were no mandarines in paradise .
there was no cantaloup melon .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them doesn &apos;t work and some of them don &apos;t work .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more expensive . and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re getting genetically changing food .
why do we do that ?
well , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies patenting lives .
we don &apos;t want to companies own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . put that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we fear is a real deadline , and it keeps millions of pe
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shame .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changing food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this stuff , like manios .
manioc is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mine .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists have all this inside .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t stand , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisses , but it &apos;s beautiful .
and everything i can say about is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , well , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to go around genes ?
it &apos;s not about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our pessibilities on greater food , better foods , unique foods .
it &apos;s not about rice crispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do that , we &apos;re going to do something guilty that we think we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly fun entertainment , you may want to say , &quot; do you will still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want to .
we need to lead these entertainments , and we need to think , but when we get into the time machine and go to the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have .
i know that we can , and as i &apos;m affected , that &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , it &apos;s because you look at it like me , as &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to b
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to her , is a pharmaceutical or a kind of , for e
a deception becomes something real because somebody perceives it .
so for us to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you an elementary , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick , which is at least since the 1950s in every magic book for children .
i &apos;ve learned him from cub scout magic on the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m explaining him .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my mind .
i &apos;m going back to my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing is disappearing or from him , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything at any time , as long as i go back here , nothing can go into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is quite easy .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything &apos;s good , the knife is going to be considered by my physical magnetism .
it actually sits on his place that i can shake it , without the knife .
there &apos;s nothing that &apos;s going on in my room or coming out , not a tricker , and you can study everything .
ta-ta ta-ta .
well , that &apos;s a trick that i often teach little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception if you look more carefully , even though it &apos;s a very simple
probably many of you here in the room have this trick .
he &apos;s working for this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m going around my wrist to make sure that nothing is disappeared or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding my wrist is that the real secret is the illusion .
in the moment , where i turn my hand out of them , so you see them from behind , this finger here moves , my show finger , just from where he was , into a position where he was .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who didn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . exactly .
and when i turn around , the finger changes his position .
and now you could talk about why that &apos;s a deception , why you don &apos;t think that the minds are , because the minds and the way it processes information , she doesn &apos;t count individual
but that &apos;s actually not there . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be successful , but not through magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my show , who &apos;s now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , is hidden by this movement that the fingers move back .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can take your friends and neighbors . thank you .
well , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago , or something , i read a study that &apos;s really watching me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
because it turns out , if you provide a placebo in a white pill in the shape of an aspirital , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you give the shape where you give the placebo , for example , change into a smaller pill , and put this blue and put that one letter , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , even though none of them are any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak out .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not everything .
if you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than any shape .
a colored capsule that &apos;s yellow and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
also , the dose is playing a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistic . i &apos;m sorry .
so the critical thing is , ...
that also the dosages are playing a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you &apos;ve got to get to the needle .
right ? it &apos;s an injection with an infectious -- a few milliter of an effective substance that you &apos;re injecting a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
this graph is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and nothing of that has any really pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s only our belief in which it &apos;s going to be a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from this study that you have to go to the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a 18-foot long hundrel . it &apos;s very , very , very , very , and i &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damian &apos;s special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now i &apos;m going to stand this needle in my skin and push through them , until she &apos;s going to enter the other side .
if you &apos;re overwhelmed -- if you drop this easy in power -- i did this a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman that i didn &
so , i &apos;m suggesting when they &apos;re quickly , then you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first secret part here .
you can see it the same , but you can also watch when you want to .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little unit .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and now a little bit about my skin and on the other side like that .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at messer trick .
it &apos;s about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , which is not so stupid and through themselves the skin , just to talk about a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people behind say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see it right . &quot;
the people in the spaces are coming in .
let me show you out of you .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you get over , look away , don &apos;t look at them .
people behind the back on the back , say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it was real , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really would be , it would blood . &quot;
okay , let me just squeeze a little blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
normally i would take the needle now .
i would clean up and show you that there &apos;s no wonder .
but i think in this framework , and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m just going to let the needle and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to find a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re enjoying it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
i have some people to count the number of books that were published in the last five years , and they gave after about 40 , and there were much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of the interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of this flood of work , there are several cognitives that are almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to act mostly by these cognitive falls .
that &apos;s going for lains thinking about your own luck , and it &apos;s for scientists thinking about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just like everybody else .
the first of these falls is to address a complexity .
it turns out that the word fortune is not a useful word , because we apply it too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could constrain it , but in big and what we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second case is a confidence and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both together in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the concentration illusion , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about one thing , which is affecting well-being without distorting its meaning .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive drop .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer , after one of my lectures , who told a story , and it was absolutely lovely music , and at the end of the reco
and then he asked , really quite emotional , which has ruined the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories to the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was left with a memory , the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he got to keep .
what that really says is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s an experience self that lives in the present and knows the present , capable of experiencing the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the experience self that tells the doctor -- you know when the doctor asks , &quot; does it really do when i take you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory self , and the memory self is that is counting and getting the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the physician asking , &quot; how did you feel the physician ? &quo
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or similar .
these are two very different units , the experience self and the memory self , and the two to confuse is part of the confusion of the fortune .
well , the memory self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it begins immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that are underlying a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to tell all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more of them ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has clearly slipped more clearly , and his force was longer , and every minute of pain that patient had patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how much these patients thought they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients had a much worse emergence to the performance than patient ...
the stories of the performances were different , and because a very critical part of the history is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very assembly or great -- but one of them is clearly ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the one that was worse is where the pain was at the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their performance , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse than for as a for being remembered .
well , this is a direct conflict between the experience self and the memory self .
from the view of the experience self , clearly had a worse time .
well , what you could do with patient and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been made , and it works , you could actually extend the piece of patient about just shaking the sound
that &apos;s going to lead the patient suffers , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve done that the experience self is worse on their own patient , and you &apos;ve done that the memory of the patient is much better down because now
what does a story draw ?
and that &apos;s going for the stories that makes us memory and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
which is what a story are about , significant moments and ends .
ends are very , very important , and in this case , dominated the end .
well , the experience self lives his life continuously .
it has one moment of experience , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve calculated this -- you know , psychological present than about three seconds long . which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of t
most of them will be completely ignored by the memory self .
and yet they somehow get the impression that they should count , what &apos;s our life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we are in the world .
and how we use them to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory self for us .
so we have the memory self and the experience self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the difference with time .
from the view of the experience , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two week &apos;s going to be twice as good as the one-work .
that &apos;s not working at all for the memory self .
and for the memory self , a two-way vacation is not better than the one-women &apos;s holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , the critical variables that a memory itself is different from an experience self . time has very little impact on this story .
well , the memory self makes more than remembering and stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because when you have a patient , which decides that the memory has the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s ch
the experience self has no voice in this choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experience .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think about our future , we don &apos;t normally think of the experience .
we think about our future as a previous memories .
and basically , you can look at that , as a tyranne of the memory self , and you can think about the memory self as one that doesn &apos;t need the experience self through experience that doesn &apo
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we do this very often the case , that means we &apos;re increasingly in the service of the memory self .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we driving from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of the memory self .
and when i think about it , i think of an operation that we did a couple of years ago in antarctica that was clearly the best failure i ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to how oft
and i &apos;ve probably from my memories of this three-week journey , i would say about 25 minutes over the last four years .
well , if every opened the order with the 600 images , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s three weeks and a half hours .
there seems to be a distinction .
well , i &apos;m going to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetit i have on the tens of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question : why do we give memori
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the location , all of their pictures , and they get an amnesia drug so they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you were going to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self , and you have to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really no
why we &apos;re looking for the picture that we &apos;re looking for is a problem that takes us with a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the experience itself ?
and then you wonder , how happy are the moments in the life of the experience self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re actually a pretty good idea from the happiness of the experience self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the memory self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s how happiness , the person is when this person is thinking about their lives .
very different terms .
everybody who doesn &apos;t distinguish the exploration of happiness , and i belong to a lot of researchers about well-being that studied the exploration of happiness in this way .
the distinction between the happiness of self and the happiness of the memory self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separations .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the 
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the self &apos;s happiness .
and the main lesson that we believed is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how satisfaction is somebody with your life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he lives his life and reverse .
just to give you an impression of correlation , the correlation is about 5. .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s lived his life as an eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his experienced self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what &apos;s happiness happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means being happy with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , they will do very different things at the end .
the conclusion of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we actually shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , quite short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you may think that people in california have to be happier when they say , live in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , they think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , let &apos;s say , in the climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the experience self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the kind of thinking self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the thinking itself is responsible , you can do at the end -- some people could end up with california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who go to california in the hope of being happier .
well , your experience self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because when you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll fe
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you an impression of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
well , when we telephoned a couple of weeks ago , they mentioned that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallul poll .
is this something that you can participate in because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome that we found in the gallup poll is a number that we had absolutely not expected .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the experience self .
when we looked at how feelings are varied with the income .
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , un
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappy , the poorer they get .
that &apos;s what we get absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t have an experience , but that lack of money you certainly made your elves , and we can measure this line very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the memory self , get another story .
the more money you deserve the more happiness you &apos;re .
that &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , all over american entirements , it &apos;s about life , freedom , which is going for happiness .
when people would take this finding seriously , i mean , it seems to be everything in the head , everything we believe in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there an opportunity that politicians , that the country would generally take one field like the serious and make it based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness research in politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , she &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s happening in other countries .
people are about recognizing that they should think happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to experience experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life rating , so we have to do this discussi
how to increase happiness very differently depending on how they think and whether they think about the memory self , or whether they think about the experience self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to get the experience of the experience of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades , i think , be part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me that it &apos;s going to be , or at least the most interesting political debate to follow for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kanman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design computer games .
i &apos;ve developed online for 10 years now . and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in the reality of how to save in online play .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including you all , spending more and greater and greater games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week with online per week .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for play . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that there was 21 billion hours a week at the game per week .
and that seems to be something like that , so i repeat it , so i repeat it : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , i think we have to try to play games online for at 
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i believe that games are so incertainable for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil toleans .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play , so he &apos;s built a camera before the players .
this is one of the classical expressions playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also dependent in solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;ll see some nuances here , who pulled up , and the mouths are a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of something called the epis sea .
oh , you know that . ok . prima . so we have some players here .
an epic six is a result that &apos;s so positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when you achieve it , they &apos;re actually shocked that they &apos;re actually capable of this . that &apos;s an epish .
this player is short from an epis .
and that &apos;s what we need to see on million faces of problem-solvers around the world , if we take the towns of the next century , and the face of the ones that stand on the edge of all the epic
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life when we meet difficult problems .
i call it as the &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; face , and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yeah ? ok .
that &apos;s me how i &apos;m doing the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better than in play than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing in the reality .
and i don &apos;t mean not just less successful , even though that &apos;s heard of it .
we &apos;re getting more in players . i &apos;m good at the relationship with motivation , something significant , inspired collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a player , i think many of us are transformed into our best version , any time and immediately helpful , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary it try after the failure .
and in the reality , when we fail failures , we &apos;re often feeling differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel like we feel threatened , we might be depressed , frustrated or cynical .
these feelings have never played when we play games , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a doctor .
why is it impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to collaborative problem solves .
and i &apos;ve discovered some things that make the epic pieces of online in online worlds .
so first , when you get into one of these online games , especially at the world of warcraft , there are lots of different characters that are willing to trust them a world-saving mission , and that
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to their current level in the game , right ?
so they &apos;re going to do that .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , so you have to strike . but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and turns them . there &apos;s always to do something important .
and there &apos;s collaborators .
where they also go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epis mission .
we don &apos;t have that in the real life so simple , that feeling that a finger station is willing to stand employees .
there &apos;s this epic history , this inspirational story why we are , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; two percent , &quot; or &quot; an intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in true life .
when i leave that stage , i didn &apos;t -- one percent speak , and two-crazy idea , 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of cooperation online as world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying at any time on the edge of the epish view that we &apos;re going to spend all of our time in these player
they &apos;re just better than reality .
to these today , all the world of warcraft player has spent 5.33 million years to solve the virtual problems of acrebth .
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound everybody .
but to see that in the context : 1.53 million years ago , our first primate ancestors started to go .
so the first primate is primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend in play with play , it just makes sense , when you think about time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that by using all this time on play , actually changing what we are as humans .
we &apos;re developing to collaboratively thinking , very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher by carnegie mellon university : the average young person today in a country with strong play culture spends 10,000 hour
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10,000 hours who are spending exactly time that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to finish the high school -- if you never miss .
so we &apos;ve got a complete paralligation that young people learn how to be a good player , like everything they learn in school .
and maybe some of them have read the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; over fliers . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the study of any subject until the 21st , we &apos;re going to master in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever to do , like the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players .
so the big question is , &quot; what &apos;s exactly where players are good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have human potential before .
so many people , we have in the world that spend at least one hour per day with online play .
these are our master players . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry develops consoles that save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than the broadband internet , players around the world , especially in india , particularly in india , china
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is to master .
here are the four things i found . first , urbanity optimism .
ok , imagine that like extreme self-motivation .
urgency optimism is demand immediately to do something to do a hurdle , together with belief that we have an elementary hope in success .
players believe always believe that an epis is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spider of dense social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investigations that show people more after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve beated us .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that somebody spends with us that the rules are going to be that we have the same goal and remain the playing .
so that allows you to play the growth of bonds , trust and with each other .
as a consequence , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the average world of warcraft players are playing 22 hours a week as a part-time job .
the reason is , when we play , we are actually happier to work hard than if we relaxed or nothing .
we know that we &apos;re optimally working as a human being , if we do hard , meaningful work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and eventually , epic meaning .
players love to love to get part of the most planetary missions .
here &apos;s a background information to go back to the right . you know all the wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 , the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve come together more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic in every other wiki in the world .
they create an epis story .
they create an epic source of knowing about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individuals .
and the only problem is that you think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronovy is a people scientist .
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to figure out of not less than a mass emigration in virtual worlds and online playing environments . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says .
it &apos;s not like me ... i develop play , i &apos;m a little bit of transformative .
so he says that &apos;s actually meaning , because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life .
they can take play stronger social connections than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than the real world .
i first agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from one event , which is 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cubes , from sheep kills . you know ?
in front of these fantastic games controllers , there was sheep .
and these were the first of people developed play .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historian in herodots , you may know this story . the story about how play were invented .
according to herodotus , games , the special cube games , invented lydia during a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of lydies decided to be a crazy idea .
people suffered . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube play and posted a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so interested in the cube play , because games are so fascinating and with satisfying , happiness productivity , surrounded that they were forgotten that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survived this famine so 18 years by eating on a day and the next player .
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re putting games to extract the suffering of the real world .
we put games to emerge everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re going to take us what we need from play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , the famine wasn &apos;t better after 18 years , so the king was decided to sit one last cube game .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a cube and the sitters that were allowed to break into an epic adventure .
they left the lydies , and they were looking for a new home . they &apos;ve just returned so many people back to survive , and they were looking for food to survive , and they could take the rest of
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence shows that the extremers that formed the roman empire , the same dna like the old lydies .
and so scientists came recently to the idea that herodote &apos;s crazy story actually got .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which took almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story might agree .
maybe they actually saved her people in games by looking in games for 18 years , and then had this intuition and then learned so much about what they have saved the whole civilization .
so that &apos;s what we can .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
this was the first strategy game in real time of warcraft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years playing back games , we played play for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic play .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion play hours a week .
we should be able to income that half of us spend an hour per day with games until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;ll ask , &quot; how do we solve the problems of the real world in playing ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done my work in the last years in the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it presses how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people encourage this idea to deal with reality .
we &apos;re imagining epic six before and we give people the opportunities to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i designed to try to give people epish epish lies in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s online where you have to overcome an oil space .
the oil spill is invented , but we have enough online content so it &apos;s going to be realistic and they actually live their real life in real times that you live , and then you get to their real 
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied it for the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change your life , because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going out of oil . &quot;
that &apos;s an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have learned the habits in the game .
and so we &apos;ve got a bigger play for the next world-specific game than just oil spills .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
the starting point is the computation of a supercomputer that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global extinction system , &quot; of course .
the call for players to sign up , we have designed almost like a jerry brickneess movie .
you know jerry brucketries movies where there &apos;s the dream team , and they have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-sterling and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just people , we say , everybody is in the dream team , and it &apos;s our task , the future for energy , food , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read if they google &quot; superstructure . &quot;
and the last game we get out on the 3. march -- it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you finish the game , they get the world bank the relationship &quot; social recovery , &quot; by 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and they &apos;re going to start to learn how social reforming .
we have a comic . we have &quot; levels &quot; for regional understanding , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , everywhere in the world , especially in developmental areas that are benefiting from imagining their own social enterprises to save th
i &apos;m going to come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we didn &apos;t have the real world .
well , i hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that play has a big meaning for change .
we have all these superforces , happiness productivity , the ability to create lots of social nets , urgency optimism and desire to epice meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing games together to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me .
when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create each future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the world-changing games start !
thank you .
and i &apos;d like to tell you something that was starting to do a few months ago in the writing of an italian article for italian .
i &apos;ve always written my synonymous dictionary , but i was already done with the process of the text , and i fell that i &apos;ve never looked at my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; mea
i read them the contribution .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjective , &quot; helpless , useless , destroyed , destructed , measured , familiar , counted , countered , generated , countering , countered , useless and weak .
antonymous : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read that list of a friend , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i couldn &apos;t continue to read , and i couldn &apos;t collect me more , and myself , after this overload , and th
of course , this was a freezed , old synnomy dictionary , and i just thought that the exercise has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when i was starting with elementary school and started building my sense outside of my family environment and shape and form , also in terms of 
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use synonymous dictionary at the time .
and i would take that position seriously i would be born into a world that somebody like me perceives me as a person whose lives can &apos;t do positively today , but today i &apos;m going to celebr
so i immediately called up the online copy of 2009 , and expected to find a more special contribution here .
here &apos;s the actualized version of that entry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; near antonyms &quot; is &quot; healthy and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of ancient societies , including the greeks and the romans , they really believed that the exception of a flucture has a great force because what you &apos;re talking about is also manifest .
so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled people or a powerful people ?
a human being alone has eightly as a child , could enough to restrict them and transform them imagination .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open them doors ?
a person who opened doors for me was my pediatrician at the a.d. dupont institute in wilminggon in delaare .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzlo . an italo american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t talk about correctly , so he was always called dr. p.. .
and dr. p. garrier always fly very college and was just created for work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- to my physiotherapy .
i had to repeat individual practices with these thickness , elastic bands -- in different colors -- that &apos;s what they have to create my leg muscles , and i hated these things more than anything
and imagine i &apos;ve actually negotiated a five-year-old child with dr. p. , and so to stop this exercise , of course , without success .
and one day he watched me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tiring and gloss -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you 
and when you get it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so i do the practices that i didn &apos;t want to do with the view that the richest five-year-old girls are in the disease in the second stick 
and i wonder how much his vision from me as strong and powerful young girls could imagine my self-image and i imagined to see me as one of nature from strong , powerful and atlethic person .
this is just one example of many , like adults in power positions , the imagination of the imagination can actually provide the imagination of a child .
but as the examples have been quoted examples from the synonony dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t let us imagine what we all want to imagine : every single person to allow us to see themselv
our language comes back to the social changes that have been caught in many cases through a technology transformation .
and of course , from the medical standpoint , of course , say that my legs , the laser surgery for visualizations , knees from titan and artificial jumps for aging bodies that have her natural desti
so perhaps this technological change is clearly because ever , there was another truth , which is that every human society can give something very special and very powerful and that the human abilit
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me about how i &apos;m doing with curiosity and i &apos;m going to give you something th
this sentence is living from the idea that success or happiness depends on the idea of masting a challenge without being connected , as if my life would have so successful because i could make the p
but the truth is that we change . of course , we &apos;re challenged by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional or even both of these is .
and i &apos;m suggesting that &apos;s good .
curiosities are not an obstacle that we need to curve to get better with our lives .
curiosity belong to our lives .
and i tend to see curiosity as my shadow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s constantly in me .
and i don &apos;t want to get the impact on the heavy of a human being .
there &apos;s lives in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just all real and each person is different with it , but the question is not whether we come with curiosity or not , but how we can get
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve fates , but they &apos;re also preparing to get clearly .
and we don &apos;t process our children , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to see two things : to be amputated , to be amputated , and the other social minds about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and remaining disability that i had to set apart is that the world is constantly , it can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are heart and the cold hard truth about their medical projections , or even a projection to the quality of life that they expect , we have to realize that som
maybe that &apos;s the moment of concept that sees only on what is broken and how we repair that , for every single one of the major disabilities than the pathology .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being holistically , and not perceiving all of their forces and opportunities and recognize the natural struggle that you might lead to , another disease .
we degrade a people who has a value for our society .
so we have to look at the pataology and focus on all areas of human possibilities .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s between the perception of our relationships and our great invention , there &apos;s a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t review these challenging times or denial , we should not try to avoid them , we should turn them underneath the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing the opportunities .
i mean , it &apos;s more likely to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome directions , but we &apos;re open for them , they &apos;re opening to put them on the creation to use them
and maybe we &apos;re going to create the directions than something natural , voice and useful , and feel that through their presence through their presence .
in this year ago , we celebrate the 200th birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution , 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in something very true in the human char
i would survive it as well , not the most powerful its species , and not the most intelligent of his way , but who can adapt to change best .
from conflicts , creativity comes from conflicts .
it &apos;s not just darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive , to survive and float , from the struggle of the human mind , transforming through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of human .
and maybe we &apos;re only knowing which wood we &apos;re cut if we were really cracked .
potentially , that &apos;s the sense of curiosity , a perception of the ics , a sense of our own power .
we can give you something about it yourself .
we can give a new meaning that goes out over heavy times .
maybe we can see curiosity as change .
curiosities are standing for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
and i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve added ourselves is believe that we should be normal .
honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical . but not the normal , and would you really want to learn that poor , gray person really want to learn from them ?
i don &apos;t think more .
it would be great if we could get this paradigm of the normality against another opportunity or the strength , to exchange it a little bit more dangerous . so we can put the forces of very many kids
anthropologists have found that we have required people from the members of our societies to be useful and affording a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals are having older people and people with heavy physical injury , and that may be because the life experience was valuable for these people for society .
they didn &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i grew up in the city where i grew up in a food market in that &quot; red zone &quot; in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood in front of a suiff .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullin . &quot;
and i &apos;m turning around and see this older man . i had no idea who it is .
and i said , &quot; excuse , sir , you know , i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her for the first time , i got them out of your mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so this .
and of course , it &apos;s done click .
this was dr. kean , a man who i knew about this day from this day , because , of course , typically at my birthday two weeks to late .
and the doctor for preatal diagnostics of my mother was in the walk , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without growing legs , and my feet on the other foot , and i had a couple of toes on the other foot , and some toes on the other foot , he had to bring the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents that you would never run , and never be so moving as other children , or you could never lead an independent life , and since they just did me . &quo
really extraordinary , i found that he had collected newspapers in my entire childhood , whether i won the little letter competition in the second class , whether i was going to teach my scholarship
and he called this part of his course : the factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor can be the quality of a human life .
and dr. kean said , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they don &apos;t get something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , when you leave kids to yourself , then children
you see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and as somebody deals with it , two different things are .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you were asking my prostheses against legs and bones , then i wouldn &apos;t have a second .
i didn &apos;t want to work at the time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i experienced something with my legs , and not despite these experiences .
and maybe that change could happen because i &apos;m so many people that opened me doors , instead of measuring people that restrict me or wanted to transform me .
you see , it really needs a people who demonstrates them how to manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , inner forces , the human mind is so recent -- if you create that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these peop
they bring them to open yourself doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; roots in the word &quot; educate . &quot;
it means to produce something that &apos;s in one is to tickle the potential out .
again , what potential we want to call ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. was done a case study , and then gymans were transformed into total schools .
they call them there &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are shared for grades .
and the students are really harder , they get the better teachers .
and then they have given over a three-month period of students with an &quot; enough , &quot; given the note &quot; very well . &quot; it &apos;s told them that they were very smart , and after thes
and of course , it &apos;s breaking your heart to hear that reverse has been said to the one student , they &apos;re just enough .
and that &apos;s exactly what it was , after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students that had shot the school .
it &apos;s quite critical about this trial was that the teachers weren &apos;t going on .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something has changed .
they were just said that they were the one students , and that &apos;s the students with the grade , and the same way they taught them something , and they &apos;ve taught them something .
the only real disability is a broken spirit that &apos;s broken , has no hope more . he doesn &apos;t find anything more beautiful ; he &apos;s missing our natural , childlen curiosity and our innat
but when we create to support the human mind , continue to hope , themselves and other people around them to find beautiful and phantagious , then we set our forces really positive .
when a mind has these qualities , we can make a new reality and new shapes .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that &apos;s been missed by a persian poet called haifi in the 14th century , and my friend jacques demois told me , not the god of the name , not the god of the na
come , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose , i said that , through few changes of your genes , a better memory could have -- more precise and faster .
or want to be fitter , more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how could it be living longer at good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always seeing for more creativity .
which one would you fall the most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a couple . probably about as many as there are creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
a couple more .
how about fitness ?
a few less less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to look at the doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a constant topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor to the subject .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , dg. dobahnsky , who was also a communication in the russian orthodox churches , wrote an approach , with the title , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;
well , if you &apos;re one of these that don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch your hearing device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission
but when you accept biological evolution , it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it some other things , or is it affectively for other people ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life &apos;s tree , all the existing species on the tops of these branches have suc
the human part of this bush , far at the end , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe there were 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the life , but actually the basic part , the basic mechanisms are quite same .
is you clear that we can use them and require the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
this is not like human insulin , this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically distinguishable from what &apos;s coming out of the pancreas .
and as we &apos;re talking about bacteria already , you know that each of us in our gut more bacteria leads more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think about when antonio damasio asks for your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all nutrients that you could only do without effort .
it &apos;s a really easy for bacteria , with occasional interruptions of the unintended , however , forced to except .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important for your life .
they help the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
are we in some kind of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that maybe even better to the environment ?
now let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living , maybe three to four
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just measured -- the animal kingdom , like a single tack , and the human life , a little note destruction .
that &apos;s what we were .
and this also provides the entertainment of this speech , so i hope i &apos;ve loved it .
well , when i was a newine on college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i asked something very fundamental -- in most of the existence of life in single organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell
but at the time , as a multi-cellular organisms , things started to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , which is passing the genome , the rest of the body is essential .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies in the evolution in the same moment emerges as sexual reproduction .
now , i have to stand up when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex death , sex death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each year , it seemed to be dou
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who led their show in las vegas , in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a plap on his hotel room .
it opens the door .
there &apos;s a beautifully dressed show .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came up with the doctor that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictive , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to be healthy .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the passenger of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation to generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i developed like boster rockets to send the genetic fight into the next stage of the orbit to fall into the sea .
i think we would all the mood that the woody all for expression brought to expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
i want to achieve it by not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily prefer the longest lives .
it &apos;s not inevitably the largest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution privileges the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and such survival .
because of the ocean , the bacteria are thermophil that are thermophil , and they survive the hot struggle , when fish were there , it would have a vacuum to do there , yet they were able to make an
so , what does that mean when we look back and what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place that people in evolution , and especially what we &apos;re looking into the next
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons that we would be through medicine is to get a lot of genes that were otherwise that had been elected and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species have been so configured our environment that we &apos;ve done that they &apos;re adapting to us , exactly what we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and circulate and circulate us so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find out .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be an evolution of the traditional species , of course , excited by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly , but they &apos;re incredible .
and so far as the isolation is going , if we put as a species of planets , it &apos;s going to be isolation and the changes of the environment that could make evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a tricking , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it the neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just , but led and decisions about us as individuals in the decisions we &apos;re doing .
well , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we &apos;re doing this ?
so let &apos;s look at the reality that people today , in some cultures are doing decisions about their decisions .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations that would heal and prevent the diseases .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s , or eliminate the cancer risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
when we look forward , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
in the next year , when it finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time , until the reality is that it &apos;s going to give 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering left the drape prize for francis arnol and will strummer , two scientists that encourage the natural process of evolution that calls the natural proc
a couple of years ago , the laster price of scientist shinya yamanaka was taken for his research , which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and through the manipulation of only four genes ,
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can be viruses that can &apos;t just protect themselves , but also the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study with vaccine with vaccine against influenza that has been built into the cells of the tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good that comes from tabacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future will be much more possible .
imagine just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells in your body ?
what if they could change the sperms and ecultries or the frightening ice to give their children a better opportunity for a healthier life , remote the diabetes , the hemophilians reduce the risk of
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , also could also allow us to adopt super attributes , hyper-capacity -- the better memo
why don &apos;t the striking of a ken jenning , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of watson machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that are going to enable you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
they &apos;re going to be incredible .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by old style evolution to neo-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires the rule that requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it in thousands of years , and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren are going to happen .
do we use these decisions to shape a society that &apos;s better that &apos;s more successful , the more friendly ?
or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want to have for some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to form a society that &apos;s more uniformed and uniformed , or robust and more expansive ?
these are the kinds of questions that we &apos;re going to have to feel .
and at the deepest of all , we will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need is to make these decisions ways ?
in the good like in evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions are going to be .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you overhuman skills , or another , where the wheelchair driver helps to stand up and go again .
we at berkeley bionics , these robots call the exosketeletons .
they &apos;re not something other than something that you stop in the morning , and that &apos;s going to continue their strength and help them increase their speed and help them help them balance .
that &apos;s actually the real member of people and machine .
but not only that -- they merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers who carries about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the question that they should wear more equipment
of course , this leads to some of the important complications -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic back injury .
so we thought we would approach this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human universal load carrier .
soldier : with the hull exceleton , i can wear 200 pounds over different terrain , many hours .
his flexible design allows you to hook at deep , to create and pretty much movement movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go , and then increases my strength and expense .
we &apos;re the way with our industrial partners of this device , this new exoskeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s look at our look at the wheelchair drivers , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who sit in the world &apos;s wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the entire population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a very young people with spinal cord injury , which have been in their lives &apos; 20s -- 20 , 20s -- from the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose numbers are multiplished .
and pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a brain , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , for 500 years , since her , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the area of mobility .
so let me just imagine you that &apos;s carried by amanda boxtel about 19 years ago , which suffered a spinal cord injury , which was the result that she couldn &apos;t walk anymore for 19 years and
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegals .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches that are sending signals back to our obnobi computer that &apos;s here on their back .
here are also batterial packagings , the engine is on their hips , also like your plys that you &apos;re moving forward in this pretty much and very natural gange .
i was 24 years old , and i was in best , as a monstrous puzzle tree , while a skivaboard paralyzed me .
in the fraction of a second , i lost every sense and every movement underneath my body .
not long after that , a doctor step in my hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every hope from my consciousness .
adaptive technologies have been since to learn how to drive again , driving again , to climb and even drive with your hands .
but nothing that would leave me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda and all the wheelchair drivers , but for everybo
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m cheater of the development organization called robin hood .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;ll fight as a fireman man in a volunteer delevation in a volunteer deletion .
well , in our city , where volunteers supported a highly qualified professional grid , you &apos;ve got to be pretty early on the burden to be able to mix .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the brand place , so i had pretty good opportunities to be inside .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the responsible main man and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the main man , he had just in a very serious entertainment with the householder that certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was middle on the middle of the night , and she was standing in the sleeping and barm under a screening rain , while her house stood in flames .
the other volunteer who would get started in front of me -- let &apos;s call it lex luther -- we got the main man first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the home owner .
the dog ! i was speechless .
there was any lawyer , now for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he went into a burning house to save a living thing , because he was five seconds faster than i was five seconds .
well , i was the next next .
the main man would work to yourself .
he said , &quot; bezo , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
you have to go up at the fire , and this woman have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i &apos;d hope to do , but i went up -- the stairs up , up the river , the real &quot; firemen , who were pretty finished at that point with just a few shoes at that point .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met at the door door , and the beloved dog .
we were wearing our estimates outside to the house owner , where , not surprisingly , its more attention got more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the firewaker got a letter in which she thought about the charter use in saving their house .
one about everything estimated kindness : somebody even brought a couple of shoes .
in my profession in robin hood and in my profession as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m struck by generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i &apos;m also looking at the motter of the individual
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i look around in this room and see people who have either accomplished an observative success or on their way there , i want to offer memory : wait not wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another until they got their first million .
if you &apos;ve got something , they give it right now .
they use in a soup kitchen , space a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
it &apos;s not every day an opportunity to save us the life of a human life , but every day the possibility of changing us to change one .
so let &apos;s put it , save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women lead the ceptor with sex &apos;s hallo , and the game determines the day -- where is fun a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not burning or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , her relativement .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees together with chimpanzees together with chimpanzees are committed to our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are famous for your aggressivity .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect overwhelmed in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
while chimpanzees are leaded by large , feature , the bonobo society is led to empowered females .
they &apos;ve really come up with , because that leads to an extraordinary tolerant society in the deadly violence in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under the primates .
they live in the depths of the congolese urbands , and they &apos;re very difficult to observe .
the congo is a paradox -- a country &apos;s extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the action of the darkness for decades , and almost asked so many liv
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction is also endangering the bonobos .
flesh and the decline of the tree position leads that you couldn &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees shake .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; monkeys , because you &apos;ve got a bisexual sex with changing partners , and rules so conflict and social affairs .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the lives of the bonobos is more than the cama of sura .
bonobos -- how people -- love to play their lives .
game doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
for us , and it &apos;s playing fundamental for the treatment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
game increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you observe bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human laughters , dances and rituals .
play is the kit that &apos;s contributing to us .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some of the unique shots out of the wild .
first , a game on bonobo art -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here we see a young female and males in a tracking game .
look at what it does .
this might be the evolutionary origin , &quot; she &apos;s packing it on the eggs . &quot;
only that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
yeah .
so sex plays are spread , both bonobos and in people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea that you bring new elements into the game -- like the trods -- and how the
but the game is a shape .
play is a forms , and it can take a lot of shapes that some of which are something little bit more quieter , curious , curious -- maybe to discover that again .
and i want to show you , that &apos;s fuco , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
and i think just like you play sometimes alone , and we loot limits of our interiors and outside worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research and interact and interact , and the unexpected links that we &apos;re forming are the real neighborhoods of creativity .
this is just a little task on the insights , the bonobos into our past and present .
but they &apos;re also a secret to our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , by bigger creativity and expressive cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptation .
in order to adapt us to an uncomfortable world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best out of our play ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life isn &apos;t from teeth and claws alone .
and just when it seems to hardly , play is perhaps most necessary .
and therefore , my primate characters , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover the creativity of the camera and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 , at the exact same day , every single moment , everybody gets a baby -- okay .
so two couples , everybody &apos;s going to give a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time , because , if you imagine generation all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case , the sperma is carrying a chyomosome that meets to the x chromosome of the ocean .
and in the other case , the sperm is a chromosome that &apos;s meeting on the chromosome of the one .
they &apos;re both survival , both of these .
we still get back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two huts .
underneath a hat , i &apos;m engaging with the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied historian , and in this case , i &apos;m studying how people were able to do with anatomy -- -- human body , animal bodies , animal bodies -- how they were doing with body fluids ,
the other thing i &apos;ve carried about my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as impatient lawyers -- from people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have body types , the social norms in question .
so for example , i &apos;ve been working with people , the siemese twins , two people in one body .
i &apos;ve been working with people &apos;s ground -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often i &apos;ve been working with interesual people whose gender is attypical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the word interesuality .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of the possible types of gender , which don &apos;t respond to the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have somebody with a xy chromosome base , and the syr gene of the chomosome is putting the protogona that we all have the protogona that we all have to dead .
and that &apos;s why the testosterone in the fetal stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosteron , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testor .
and that &apos;s called a drug receptor defect .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to that .
as a consequence , the body develops more of the typical female course .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s going to get up as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until they reach puberty and growing their breasts and develop it , but it doesn &apos;t get their period until somebody gets something different .
and they &apos;re doing some tests , and they find that instead of supports and certainty , in reality , carrying themselves , and that it has a chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could hold this person for actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called andrenaline .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the benefits are putting androgens that are virilizing hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i believe a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome building , but i think i &apos;ve probably have the typical -- most of women like i &apos;m talkin
we produce annoring , and we &apos;re talking about androgens .
and the consequence is that somebody like i actually had a brain that was more androgens than a woman who was born with hotes and has an androgen receptor defect .
so gender is really complicated ; interestuals don &apos;t just stand in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , can be distributed across the whole range .
another example , a few years ago , i got the call from an 19-year-old man who was born as young , who was born as young , he lived a friend of his girlfriend , and he was just figured out that he h
he had an extreme form of an innovated hyperblash hyperblash .
he &apos;s got 87 chromosomes , and in the world , his next so strongly active that they created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genitals were exposed to male , his brain was exposed to the more typical male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody ever did something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually because he inside the mentructured that the doctors found out he was in the inside of female .
okay , just a quick example for a variation of interesuality .
some people with x7 chromosomes , developing something that &apos;s called ovotestics , where stock tissue is arresting from head tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can reach in many different variations .
the reason why children with these kinds of bodies -- be it &apos;s graduate or simeesic twins , because it &apos;s interesting -- from surgeons to be adapted to the norm is not because this would b
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why there are often different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomical expression is made with a certain identity .
so we &apos;ve got the concept that a woman is called a female identity -- being a black person , means to have an african anatomy in terms of your own story .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re confronted with a body that actually represents something very different for us , this confuses us in terms of these categories .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it then if children are born , who are two people in one body .
in the last time i &apos;d experienced most excitement , south african groups in caster semenya last year , whose gender was asked list year at the world championship in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me with the question , &quot; what tests are you going to tell us whether caster semeya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature doesn &apos;t move between male and female , or interesting and intersecully , and interestingly , we &apos;re in that
so we &apos;ve got a situation where the further our science progresses , we have to stand up to get these categories that we held for stable anatomic categories , which are very simple statements t
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be much more complicated when our terminology has allowed .
in our looking at our looking , we &apos;re going into all kinds of uncomfortable areas .
for example , we &apos;re pushing on the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in common .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them through few nucleoties ?
while we &apos;re going to push our science and further , we get increasingly into a zone of the uncomfortable , where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories that we had probably too si
we see it in all sorts of human lifes .
one of the areas in which we see this in our culture today , in the world &apos;s united states , the fights over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what point a body is going to be a body to humans so that he has a different right than the fetal life .
we &apos;ve got very difficult conservations today -- perhaps not so public like in medicine -- about the question when somebody is dead .
our ancestors had never had hard to fight with the question when somebody was dead .
they &apos;ve been keeping up a sittle bit under the nose , and when she moved , they didn &apos;t have them yet .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , you burst them .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we humans are taking very important organs and make them plant other people .
and as a consequence , we struggle with the really difficult question , when somebody is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult thing in which we don &apos;t have that simple categories a
now you might assume that the entire collapse of categories would make somebody like me like me really happy .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are actually much more insecure than we thought that these categories are actually much more insecure than we thought that these categories are really much more inse
and it &apos;s related to me in relationships that democracy is appropriate .
so , to tell you about this tension , i &apos;ve got to know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were racists , i know they were sexists , but they were great .
i think they were so cockre and strong , and so radical , where they were doing that i would look at the turning musical in 1777 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotte
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the founding fathers .
the founding fathers were the original anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they received was an anatomic concept , and they replaced it through another that was radical and beautiful and 200 years for us .
as you remember , our founding fathers were doing the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy based basically on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the old worlds didn &apos;t have a concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the birth right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the conception that people who had political power to have this political power , because of the flood line from the grandfather to the grandfather to the son and so on .
the founding fathers created this idea and replaced them through a new anatomical concept , and this concept said that all people were created .
they neveloped the play and decided that anatomically counted the commonalities , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now , they did that to part because they were part of an electric system where two things grew together .
the democracy grew up , but at the same time grew the science of the same time .
if you look at the history of the foundational fathers , clearly , many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world .
they went from explanations of operatural ways , and weat things , like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission has based on a very vague concept of birth .
they moved into a naturalist concept .
and if you look at the independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they gave us a concept of anatomical commonalities .
and with that , they have really wonderful ways prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us , was great .
so what happened years ?
for example , women who asked the electricity , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that anatomic difference is more important than the anatomic difference and said , &quot; that we sho
and women argued that successfully .
next , the successful civil rights movement came , where we humans looked like soyour truth , who said about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the marchines of the civil rights movement that says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people &apos;s different skin colors calling on anatomical communities of anatomical differences , again , successful .
we see the same in the disabled rights movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all of the communities , we need to start asking about why we &apos;re using certain separations .
well , meaning , i want to sustain certain separations , anatomically , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give you a fish the same rights like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should have the right to give your understanding of sex or married .
so there are some anatomic separations that make sense for me , and that we think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what they are , and why we keep it and why they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that have been shown in the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both of the same day in 1979 .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months , she &apos;s born in 1980 .
secret , on the other hand , will born to the birthday , so it &apos;s born on the one march in 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria three months are born , they get all sorts of rights to three months ago -- to have the right to have six months because of having the right to drink the right .
here &apos;s not because he &apos;s actually waiting for all of these , not because he &apos;s actually another biological age , just because of the moment of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other significances about what their rights are .
herrica , because you think he &apos;s male , although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s male , because you take it , he can now be moved , what maria needs to worry about .
maria can &apos;t perceive the same right that has health in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
the secret can be married a woman in every state , but maria can marry today in a few states today .
so we have these permanent anatomic categories that are problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science makes such advances in anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy that could be considered in anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like the science makes itself .
so where are we going ?
it seems like our culture takes some kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to go anywhere a line , so we &apos;re pulling it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided that texas has decided to marry , that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome and marry a woman to marry you &apos;ve got a y chromosome .
now in practice , people don &apos;t test on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the androgen receptor defect .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he provides us in his , &quot; i have a dream of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t to judge people &quot; their skin color , but judging after the property of their characteristics , and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
i &apos;d like to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be distributed rights to people , because i have to admit that i have a series of golden retrivers that probably make social perfor
i &apos;d like to say that i &apos;m probably knowing some bright lab down , who are the more capable of meeting intelligent and tiver decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40-year-ol
so how are we going to surgery the questions about the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and one part of me wondering , what if the content is something that would be something that would be done in the future of machine -- which could be made visible ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to make them thinking about questions of democracy .
in our sense of democracy , we did our things really well , and i think we would make our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually moved to other men , with death , it &apos;s because he &apos;s ready to get a gender transformation w
states of this way , we don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago who had brought some simeese twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was telephone , and he asked him why he made these interventions -- they were high risky operations -- his answer that in his country , these children would be treated very bad , and so h
i said , &quot; now did you move political asyl instead of separating them ? &quot;
the united states offers incredible opportunities to allow people that they &apos;re , without them to change the state .
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leading .
all right , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the opportunities like democracy might have looked like if we were involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s redical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are driving from different kinds of anatomy , especially when peopl
because i &apos;ve been interested in intersexuality for years , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the gender difference .
and one of the things i really found is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve experienced from cultural surprising studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- more complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable
and so when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i made a graduate student , i asked me one of my study caregers , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so it &apos;s -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what is feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about solving cliches about gender , and that &apos;s why feminism is nothing femalism .
but the more i thought about his question , i thought there might be something female in feminism .
this is supposed to be something , on average , which makes female brains of males , which makes us more attention for highly complex social relationships and worry about the protection for the prot
so where the founding fathers were extremely concerned about how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we brought more mothers into this concept , we &apos;re
and maybe it &apos;s where we &apos;ve got to go into the future , where we &apos;re going to get democracy across anatomy -- less about the individual body to think about what identity is , and thi
so that , if we try to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jesso , and this is my suitcase .
but before i &apos;m going to show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is : i &apos;m obsessed with outsits .
i love to wear another colorful support , crazy outfit , and photograph and blog and blog .
but i don &apos;t buy nothing new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand on markets and second-hand shops .
oh , thank you .
second-hand shopping allows me to reduce the influence of my hard robe on the environment , and also the one on my follow .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars are serving for usually a good purpose ; i see pretty unique , and it makes you shop to my personal shop .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
i &apos;m going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers yes , i feel like i won .
i &apos;m going back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve pushed here at ted for this exciting week .
i mean , what does anybody bring with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i &apos;ve brought into seven underneath , and that &apos;s all .
weeks for exactly one week are everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve been rather that i would want to wear everything that i might want to wear , if i got to palm springs .
and because you haven &apos;t heard of me when the woman who walks around here at ted in her underwear -- that means i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i &apos;d necessarily want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe or not , these adventures have learned nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the radiant tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including jacket cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve carried in this entire week .
montag : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad when you &apos;re wearing bright people .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation will overrate .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time of my life trying to be myself and adapt myself at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded with the right people , they will not only understand it , they &apos;ll estimate it .
wedness : embrace their inner child .
sometimes me people tell me i look like i &apos;m dressing &quot; games , or i remember them in their seven-year-old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost sure .
and if you think they &apos;re not good looking good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother that taught me the day of day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that short for her .
if you think they &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden paillets fit to everything .
and ultimately , saturday : developing your own , unique style , is a great way of telling the world something about one without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve been proving me and over and over again when people got to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit it all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to get these things emotionally , because the same around the corner will give it a different crazy , colorful outfig that just waits for me when i have a little bit love in the h
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you .
think about this as a flying education .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptial design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you is that i &apos;m going to
some time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget , and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , then they won the race .
well today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s going on in real time , some of thousands of sensors , the information from the car , that
they would call them , in engineering teams , a real time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a sensitive part and a responsive part .
what &apos;s interesting today is that the real-time control systems are starting to come up with our lives .
our cities have been , in the last few years , just extracted with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the free .
and as a computer in free , they start responding in other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
when we &apos;re doing cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
only by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world population lives there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- cause up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this perceive and drive in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paloa antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environments , start talking to us back .
in some sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom out there will be out there , a sensor and a driver .
and that changes the interaction that we humans have with our environments outside .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangel. ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped moses , it means that he took the hammer and throw it on mosses -- actually , you can still see a little bit of underneath -- and she said , &quot; perchan non pa
well , today , our environment starts for the very first time to answer .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to perceive our environment .
let &apos;s start with perception .
now the first project i &apos;d like to imagine is truth one of the first our labs .
it formed in italy four and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone net -- and anonymous and aggregated information from this network that wor
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was an italy won the football championship .
some of you are going to remember it was played in italy against france , and then back to the end of ziane , the head off .
and no matter , italy won the end .
now look at what happened on this day , only when the activity that &apos;s happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle in the middle , the flow tibet .
in the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a tower . italy makes a tower .
half-time , people make a short call , go to toilets .
second half time . end of the normal play time .
first extension , second .
ziazan , in a moment of the head of the head .
italia wins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate .
they saw the great expression .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seeter and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you can see the picture of the place massiom , where , since the roman time , people go to celebration -- to have a large party , and you &apos;re looking at the end of the day at the end of the day
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we didn &apos;t come to the city a few years ago .
even quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but things that we &apos;re using and consuming .
well , today , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is , as they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to follow the garbage while he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that helped us , a little more than one year ago , helped the things that they were twrowing -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would
and then we have the little chips , the little brands that lived on the trash and started tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle .
after a week after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
we can do the same things actually with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this happens a lot of uncertain transportations and complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day , that the cuts that we &apos;re throwing down , not just disappears that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still throwing there every day .
and if we show that to people , we can drive a behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at the mit , asaf bieerman , could tell you a lot more about the perception , and the many other wonderful things you can do with perceiving , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second p
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a couple of years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the mayor that came to us and said that spain and south europe have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were involved at mit in a work circle , imagine these tubes , and vantiles , magnetic ventiles , which open and close .
they &apos;re causing something like a water that with images from water .
when these images fall down , you can write on this , you can put patterns , images , text .
and you can close to him , and it &apos;s going to open up to get them through how you can see in this picture .
well , we &apos;ve introduced the mayor hello .
it &apos;s really like it .
and we got the commission to design a building at the expo of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavilion .
the whole building was from water .
there are no doors or windows , but when they close to him , it &apos;s going to open and let them in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s wind , if you want to reduce the syringes , they can even let the roof .
or you could conclude the building and all the architecture , like in this case , you know , that day , when you go down the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you destr
no , you don &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappear .
this is how the building works .
you see the person who wonders what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you &apos;re looking at me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not to become wet .
well , i should tell you what happened one night than any sensors stopped to work .
but actually , it was an even larger fun this night .
all the children in zarazoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that opens up to let them , but a building that still had piles and holes in the water , you had to jump without being wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use the things that we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interacting with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical images , the images of water and the projections .
and that &apos;s what brought us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these points could really begin to fly .
imagine that you could have little helicopters that fly through the air , and each of you with a little image with changing light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier , which moves with others , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have some kind of flexible screen or displays like this -- an equal formation in two dimensions .
or irregularly , in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of the image .
they can play with different ways .
imagine before the screen might just seem in different formats or sizes in different resolutions .
but then you could be only a 3d cloud that you can go to and through which they can move from many , many directions .
here you see a real flyfie control that &apos;s going down to shape like before an equal to .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so the same way we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people are controlled .
it could have an impulse of every single impulse that comes from people , of the movements of people or the same .
i want to show you something first of all .
we &apos;ve been working with robert boll , one of the best ballets dancers of our time -- the entiol of the metropolitan theater in new york and the scale -- we took their movements in 3d to use th
here &apos;s roberto dancing here .
on the left , you see the images , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a real time scan and a movement recording .
so that they can figure out the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the pictures , they can play with it and play with color movement and movement .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyfier .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working for the olympic games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people with something and changing the environment -- almost like we call the cloud movement of how to call the chief point , but w
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for an image point .
i think the remarkable things that happened last years is the last decade is that we are changed by a digital world .
this has all digitized , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , we can take for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- we can change from the digital world , of the self-organizing forces to the physical world .
it can be in our case that we use to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can take us the coming challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world for physical .
so the idea is that we actually introduce the people where they do things together , collectively do .
the cloud is again a cloud of educations , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of educations .
it &apos;s a physical shape in london , but covered with points .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , the most important moments for olympies in 2012 and benefit it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical clouds in the sky , and something about what they can go , like london &apos;s new mountain .
you can go in .
and one kind of digital light tower in the night -- but as most importantly , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
an artist , the context is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people aren &apos;t separated by nature , and that everything is connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first icebern .
i &apos;ve come up with it .
my heart rast , my heart was disappearing , while i was trying to figure out what was going on front of me .
the icebers around me , about 60 meters of the water , and i could only concern that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year after year .
its mountains are born as calf a glacier or by breaking out of ice colls .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their environments and their experience .
some people refuse to give up and climbs until the bitter end , while others are not going to collapse and collect dramatic passion .
when you look at an iceberg , you think that they &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we humans are often seeing .
but the truth is far away .
while an iceberg , i breathe its precious atmosphere .
during the iceberg , he &apos;s putting minimously drinking water free that feeds lots of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of these icebergs , as i &apos;m going to do portraits of my ancestors , where consciousness exists in this way , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt , it &apos;s not an end , but a perception of their path along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the icebergs i &apos;m photographers is very young -- some thousands of years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show an iceberg that i &apos;ve loved in customer station in greenland .
very rare , you &apos;re actually struggling with a rolling iceberg .
so here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , where he &apos;s in the water line .
you can see here , he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
that &apos;s the average size of a greenland iceberg .
he &apos;s going about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary through the work of some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked was about this guy .
his name is tempet .
temper was one of the leading graffiti artists of the &apos; 80s .
then one day he came back from walking , and he said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak .
temp is completely paralyzed today .
it can only use its eyes .
i stood up with him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world .
so we &apos;ve decided , tony -- tempt -- and supporting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him and i asked , &quot; well , that &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all paralyzes communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only when you hear the higher society layer and you have a remarkable insurance , you can actually do that .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how communicate your communication ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &apos;s butterfly and diver block ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- their fingers are running .
i standed , &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just put a check , and instead , i provided a check that i didn &apos;t have the lovest idea how to engage it .
i committed in places and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my suggestion is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;ll get him an apparatus , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s carrying all this , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from gla , graffiti research , and they have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface , and then draw with a laser point to draw the negative surface .
so they &apos;re pulling around and do art installations like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there , follow a life cycle .
it starts with the gender , and then the shimpwords come , after the bush implications , and finally , people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home and at night with my wife , and we told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , seconds , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things ,
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things and from things , we have reached some things .
first , we &apos;ve received the insurance the doors , and actually get an approach to communicate that he can communicate -- a stephen hawking machine .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you &apos;re talking to him , or get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so usual , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we &apos;ve lost seven programmers from around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i &apos;ve moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and construction theorists and anarchists have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautifully stupid to do that , and we got back , and all the images on the walls would be weight .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the beach promotion in venice , my children were introduced , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyeritrirs , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap solar glasses that we bought on the beach project of venics , some kind of copper wire and a few things from the treatment and the electronic trade .
we took a ps. camera , they put them out , they put on a lead light , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it ourselves , we can build the code for free , the soft
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
no insurance can produce themselves .
there &apos;s no hospital .
every paralyzed now can actually communicate or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temps &apos;s room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s now all of this squeez in front of the great development .
and after a year of planning , two weeks programman , two weeks programmer , and the number nights , draw tony for the first time again after seven years .
and that &apos;s an impressive image , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
we &apos;ve tended his bed so that it can see outside .
we put a projector against a wall of the parking lot of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the best of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to break into the parking space , we were also going to feel like a part of the speaker scene .
at the end , he ended up sending an email with this content , &quot; for the first time , i did something for seven years .
i feel like i was pressed underwater , and finally somebody moved down and moved my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s something like our struggle .
that &apos;s holding us in the string , and let &apos;s develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s going to come up with a magic .
and someone who has an artistic potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re about figuring out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all sorts of recognition .
we won a few prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves .
it &apos;s everything from our own pockets .
so the realities were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong tweeted over us , and then in december , heard of the time magazine than one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really classroom .
the coolest thing is -- and that closes the entire circle -- that it &apos;s this april , when moca in the inner city of los angeles are giving an exhibition called &quot; art of the streets . &quot
and that &apos;s where probably the hardest representatives of the street art scene -- banks , shepard fairyey , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is pretty comfortable .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then it makes it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyergiter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- they all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never done something to do with an eye-opening technology , but i just came up with amazing people , so that we could actually put something on the legs .
and that question should be asking you in every single day where something needs to be done , because if not me , when ? and if i don &apos;t who , who ?
thank you .
so , i &apos;m writing for children , and it &apos;s probably america &apos;s most less child bookstors .
and i &apos;m always telling people that i don &apos;t want to get like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you &apos;ve left it anywhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has done it -- richard bolling broke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle started at the high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten in the young toilet every week in the young toilet , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilets in the teacher .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was suggesting to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and back in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to record an aids organization .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found him .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got pancreatic cancer , and that i want you to give you . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that they needed to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we were taking care of them , and we gave them on their family eight because it was needed .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , met me , turned it into a box and became my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve been talking about .
the revelation , the death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved them .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this was so often mentioned here today .
it takes the same -- he needed , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while they &apos;re going up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a piece of piece , the clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack .
that sounds fear .
well , i had a unique space that day , and i sat down to 1d .
i was the only thing that could talk to the flights .
so i looked at the same thing , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had turned the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot did the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
he switches the power .
imagine a soundless airplane .
and then he said three words -- the most emotional words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; well , they &apos;re going to go into it . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the border .
i could see it in your eyes , and that was horrible , life was to end .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a hand and didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to look at all the
while i was thinking about that later , a speaker fell , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is , and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to shift something in life .
and that urgency , this goal has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was , when we were missing the george washington bridge , as pretty much hairware -- i thought , human , there &apos;s one thing that i really r
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i approached to become better at anything that i packed up .
but in my humanity , i gave my ego space .
and i refused the time that i wasted for meaningful things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to burn negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t argue with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have rights ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s where the inner starts starting , &quot; 15 , 11 , 13 . &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts of how you know it from documentation .
while we dissolved , i had this feeling , human , to die is not terrifying .
almost like we &apos;re preparing our lives for a long time .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really formed in a thought , which is that i just want one thing .
i just wished me , i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after that , i went to the performance of my daughter -- first graders , not a lot of artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i celebrate , i &apos;m like a little child .
and in the world , everything makes a sense for me .
i realized , at the time , by relating the dots to each other that it &apos;s going to be a great father to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i became the miracle to die on that day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future and come back and live differently .
my call for everybody who &apos;s flying today is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , because you think you would be forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , you &apos;re the best parents that they can be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want the iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for developing nuclear weapons is the uranium institution institution in natance .
the gray boxes you see here , these are real-time control systems .
now , if we could compromise the systems that control what threats and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with windows software ; they base on a completely different technology .
but if we create it that an effective windows virus insists on a laptop that &apos;s used by an engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the planning behind suusent .
so we start with a windows dropper .
the uses are going to be transformed into the gray box , the centrifuges and the iranian energy program demands -- mission .
that &apos;s a children , right ?
i want to tell you how we found it .
when we started our research to stuxit , six months ago , completely unknown , what was the meaning and purpose of this construct .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the windows part , the dropper part , he made from countless zero-dad driven uses .
and it seemed to be something , with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
and this provided our attention , and we started a laboratory project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and studied this construct .
and then something strange happened .
stuxiet behaved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheeses -- switched , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t do sense in my eyes .
and after we experimented with different kinds of cheese , that &apos;s what this is an attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the dropoer is actively on the gray box around when a special configuration was discovered , even when the particular program that &apos;s trying to infect on this goal .
and if it &apos;s not , then stuxnet doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , the really interest , and we started working with it , almost around the watch , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might say , for example , a u.s. american power station , or a chemistry in germany .
so we should figure out what the goal is .
so we extracted , and we decomplimated the attack code and found that it &apos;s undergraduated into two digital warships -- a smaller and a bigger .
and we also felt that they were constructed very professionally , of people who had obviously all the inside information .
they knew any bits and byts that they had to attack .
in fact , they actually knew the shoe size of the machine .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already got that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the uses are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything that we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about here -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart out of this code .
so what we first looked first were system functions because we know what these are doing .
and then we looked for timers and data structures and trying to get them with the real world -- with potential targets in the real world .
and so we needed theories about these goals that we could recover .
in order to do these theories , we call up memory that it &apos;s definitely about high sabbats , it has to be a high quality goal , and very likely it &apos;s in iran because there were most infect
well , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousands of goals .
basically , it &apos;s going on the bushea of nuclear power and on the uranium engineering plant in natance .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for centrifuges and power plants from our client &apos;s tribe . &quot;
and i called them up and called her knowledge to compare with what we &apos;ve found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital footprint with the rotational connection .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and when you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually explode the centrifuges .
and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually being slowly and incredibly happening -- obviously , in the attempt to get the waiting engineers , so that they wouldn &apos;t 
the great digital ray head -- we got an insight by looking at very different data and data structures .
so for example , the number 144 is really out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i started working through scientific literature , about how these centrifuges are built in natance and found that they &apos;re structured , in so-called cascaden , and every cascade contains 44 cen
so that made sense , it would come together .
and it became even better .
these centrifuges in iran are divided in 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the attacks ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good together .
and this gave us great confidence that we studied here .
well , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
these results were reached by several weeks .
and we often run into a deck , and we needed to collect us .
anyway , we found that these two digital warships are actually controlling on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little group heads taking a cascade , and the rotors and the rotors down , and the great gravitation comes up with six cascades in interaction and manipulating valves .
so , big and we &apos;re very confident that we actually determine what the goal is .
it &apos;s natane , and it &apos;s just nature .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by stuxiet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really cut me from the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box , and you see the centrifuges .
well , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s beginning to depend on sensors -- so for example , pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate code available during the a
and actually , this wrong dita of stuusnet has been taken before .
so , it &apos;s just like in hollywood films , where during the pursuing camera is fed the surveillance camera with before .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea here is obviously not just that the machine people in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to stress a digital security system .
we need digital security systems there where a human machine response can &apos;t respond quickly enough .
so in a power station , for example , when the great stuff is going to be quickly , you &apos;ve got to open down levels within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when the endangerements , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and not the machine leaders , the security system is going to notice .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
he has nothing to do with centrifuges , with uranicance .
so for example , he would work exactly the same way -- in a power station or a car on a car .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the uses of the u.s. sticks as we saw it at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and when you do that , you get a cyber mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most difficult environments .
we need to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start preparing for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it became a lot of things that people suspect that the message is the main organization .
is this also your opinion ?
okay , you want to really know this ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for going to have the home . thank you ralp .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years to place myself in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal mission -- dangerous .
i filmed in wars -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing that &apos;s eating here -- finally at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous in the middle .
in fact , i &apos;ve exposed to the most part of my career that seems to be exposed to terrible situations , and that &apos;s all for trying to study society &apos;s trying to explore and interestin
so when i knew i would come here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i was going to do something different .
some of you may have heard about it a couple of weeks ago , a display on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent some facebook news , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to understand named rights in my tedtalk .
really , some happy people and companies , for profits and non-profits , the only opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson was never going to let it back -- the name rights that you &apo
so what you got was , your name here is presented : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and you could fly after content to the ears , especially when i put their compa
but that &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of things .
this is just the work title .
so , despite that warning , i knew that somebody would buy the name rights .
if you were asking me about a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say this with certainty .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new movie , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going into some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing so difficult and so dangerous as with these guys going into a space .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film around product placement , marketing and advertising , which is financed by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; is that everything from up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , totally with brands -- from the field that you se
now this brand , the qualiomom stadion , the stack center ...
these people will be connected with the film in edience -- forever .
and so the movie &apos;s going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to emphasize .
it was &quot; in eggeness , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand as a title sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
that &apos;s what we sell a shoe and he &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever discovered , from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drinks they have ever had , an attention of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . 
so the idea is , except showing that brands are part of the life , actually , to get them to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the entire film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of states .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i &apos;d look forward when cege would help to reach this .
you know , it &apos;s fun , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be really people .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because that &apos;s got a negative connettion -- but you know how this is going to develop ?
how much money is needed to realize it ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s valuable to address some really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might see like a horrid of vollidiots .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the film or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
so ... meaning , not that optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about which brand .
yeah .
if you look at the people that they have to do ...
there are some places that we can turn to us .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera in &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a background .
it turns out that it meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just so , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
none wanted to do something to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they were absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertisement , to present your product so many people as possible to see it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media , and the drugs media landscape -- is it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting instrument that the mass is going t
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was this .
actually , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t be a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you put transparency in the google search is this -- this is one of the first images that seems .
i really like your species , sergey brin . now .
that &apos;s the problem : transparency -- free of deception and ducks , just discovering and looking through ; immediately , characterized by visibility and access to information , especially what 
you know , we &apos;re now listening a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes , that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , something &apos;s changing .
but why ? well , transparency is frightening -- like this strange bear , which is still growing .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land street .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
there &apos;s an entire school of cool whip .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father got me to lie -- and there he &apos;s sitting and looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency was ready to help us -- and it &apos;s because i knew john bond and richard chrish tree for years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to deal wi
so what they suddenly started understanding -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to understand , there &ap
i &apos;ve got friends who are making the great , giant hollywood films , and i have friends who make little independent films like me .
and my friends , the great , giant hollywood films , say the reason their movies are so successful at the brand partners they have .
and then my friends who make little independent movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant hollywood films ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie , ever sold . &quot;
so how do we get to see ban in the movie ?
whenever i &apos;m doing on the way , and whenever i open the medical shot , you &apos;re going to see ban dedorating .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview .
are they ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm it .
so maybe they should be in front of the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offered one of these great pieces .
either &quot; floral fusion , &quot; or a paradise wind , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men and for women -- first , rollen , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short session .
now i can answer all of your questions and give them an exceptional constitution .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are a challenger as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so making things like this -- you know , reminds people to ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe banes ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
considering technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that somebody is doing under the switches .
we &apos;re talking about cows , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh , &quot; is a super word that this category really makes something positive , in contrast , &quot; fighting smell and humility . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times freshers .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million companies .
what about me ? what about the pressure type ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that &apos;s like me , otto normal consumers .
they &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
in &apos; 80s revival &apos;s meeting on state point , except on the day .
well , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the gene , the style i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many gray ones and a stuff .
but normally , i have an accessorie , like solar glasses , or a jewelry and so one stuff .
if you were a brand , it would probably be a classic mercede cabrio .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , liss fly .
woman 2 : partly yogi , part of brooklyn girls -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the school system .
i &apos;m selling schools all over the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was delivered .
man 5 : branded alcohol creature .
does that go ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an anger brand .
i &apos;m a tome .
well , we can &apos;t be all the tome brand , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of dark glamour and more flying fly .
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who really could help me understand what &apos;s called &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson kantaman in pittsburg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nestle , ferference , helmark to discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for those , they could help me .
you &apos;ve brought their pictures , right ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to their thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
md : this world , i think , your own world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all of these things come and start from one place and for me and start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the thoughts and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are quiet . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the machine ? what puppet stage you &apos;re now ?
why is it important to research ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
what kind of metaphors have they go through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollers are you ?
eeee : no , thank you .
thank you very much .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
there were quite a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that your brand personal dection has two separate , but the morning sides -- the morgan spurlock mark is an eight-way played brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- avoiding things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re afraid , these elements , and they &apos;re welcoming to themselves , and that 
what other brands are acting ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wiimi , mini coopers and jebble .
well , there &apos;s playful brands and silent marks , these things that come and go , but a playful , significant brand is a pretty strong thing .
it &apos;s an eight-way , played brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody would ask them to describe their brand dentity , your brand , how about it ?
you &apos;re an up-attribut ? are you something that brings blood in walls ?
or are you a down attribut ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quieter , reserved , more conservative ?
up attributes are things that are playful , fresh like the fresh prince , time , adventurilly , and literally like erol flynn and agil , profane , herrich , magical and mystical and mystically .
or are they more like a down attribut ?
are they eight and moons like in 1707 ?
they &apos;re established , traditionally , protecting , compassionate , like oprah ?
if you &apos;re reliable , stable , familier , safe , safe , holy , thought and ways like the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and the no , &quot; because they weren &apos;t going to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control of the product .
but when we found 17 brand partners who were willing to get this control that wanted to do with somebody &apos;s business , and playing like me , and that finally told us to tell stories that we cou
they were able to tell the story of the neuromarket , as we tell the story of the neuromarket that you &apos;re using mris today to transmit the functional centers of the brain , to make advertising
we went to sao paulo , where they &apos;ve been banned .
in the entire city for five years , for five years , no posters , no flyer , nothing .
and we went down in school districts where companies their way to their path in the forest schools , all over america .
the incredible for me is that the projects i got the most feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they surrounded the middle case , they were talking about the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people are challenging to think that our world is challenging .
and how was that for you ? what &apos;s successful ?
well , because the film at the sundance film had festival , we can look at that .
according to burgerles was the premisers in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this movie .
it &apos;s actually just a time period of two and eight weeks .
this is only online -- no press , no television .
the film wasn &apos;t delivered yet .
there &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
he &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , eventually , the movie has got a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost every advertising that we were talking about has recommended their customers to let them from it .
something i believe is that if you get your opportunity , risks is that there are possibilities in these risks .
i think if you put people out of it , then you get them closer to failure .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you prepare the whole company to get a profit .
i feel like we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of the possibilities that you might scare .
finally , in progressing , we should call the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . you welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a large solution that &apos;s full of the way we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , gets us a little honesty of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they were presented by my good friends of emc , who paid 1100 for the name rights in ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world .
emce presents , &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of the transparency , what &apos;s happening right now ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket to the upper organization of the ted organization , the sapling foundation -- a check in the height of 3400 to fund my ted at the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i made something else in google , and i started making something with museums and art . my chesi that &apos;s today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , which i can tell you , with 17 interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and her access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i don &apos;t complain -- but i didn &apos;t have too many museums , and these art works didn &apos;t access .
so when i traveled , and to visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this sense of -- art to make the technology together with technology .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you &apos;re just going to googlerroproject.com.
you can look here in all these museums in all these museums .
there &apos;s the uffici , the moma , the hermitage , the risks , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you &apos;re going to come into two ways -- very simple .
click , and worm , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re going around , and you &apos;re amusing .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and you jump up with a click .
they are , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
it &apos;s only fun . lots of fun .
they &apos;re driving .
thank you , but the best comes up .
so now i &apos;m before one of my favorite pictures , harvesters from pieter broken in the met .
i &apos;m seeing this poison .
when the museum has given us the picture , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
these are all the metadatas .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m clicking it away .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve studied with the so-called gigapic technology .
this picture has about 10 billion pictures , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you that now .
you can go in very light and out .
you see something fun this .
i love this guy ; his expression is unfortunate .
but then they really want to be in .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
and i thought , &quot; moment , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went right , and i noticed slowly that these children are actually beating something .
i researched a little bit with some known at the met , and found out that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a gan at the breakthrough with a stick with a stick .
seemingly , it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
in order to go close , you can go to the lessons .
just to give you overwhelm , i &apos;ll zoom out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best comes up -- it &apos;s still -- in a second .
let &apos;s just quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the painstrips ?
and what if you want to see , if you want to see the masterpiece of masterpiece ?
you can really go in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite parts of this image until i really be with the runs .
that &apos;s star night , never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of others , but i &apos;m missing the time .
that &apos;s the really cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
each one of you , everybody -- rich or poor whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create their own museum -- from all of these images , they can put their own collection .
it &apos;s easy , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the zoom -- you can zoom .
this is &quot; the sand , &quot; in the national gallery .
you can send everything with notices , send their friends , and so one entertainment starts about what they feel when they look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , is the main thing , that all the wonderful things are not here from google .
they don &apos;t even come from museums .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re just going to be just about this digital medium of art and represent them online .
it &apos;s the biggest question that i recently asked me , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be an experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two half .
this is the left half that &apos;s the logical side , and then the right half that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the aptitute of every hemisphere , we could represent their brain .
for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high aptitute that &apos;s in both hemispheres 
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , collectively with most other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good amount of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good substance of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we &apos;re going out and play with it and look at how it responds , and then we &apos;re starting to develop in our intuition .
basically the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can only be on a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing at the same time is two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed .
i remember seeing a child in playing on a floor threshold .
he was a little child , and not very well in it , and he was constantly .
but i bet him taught him to play a very valuable lesson , which is the big thing you don &apos;t just leave you , and they &apos;re staying on a place .
and this is a great conceptional model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not particle physicists .
it would be a terrible model for particle physicists , because they &apos;re not playing with ground , but with these little strange particles .
and when you play with your particles , imagine all kinds of strange things -- how they &apos;re flying directly through walls , or that they can be two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago , you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that didn &apos;t like my intuition , and that may because i &apos;m not so often playing with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it .
because if all these things are particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , don &apos;t they just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel clearly better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i did a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i increase it . we &apos;re looking right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a spring board , and it &apos;s above the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip .
i went a clean space with new silicons , and rocked for 100 hours on all the great devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swimming pool and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be the quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all sorts of strange things , but then other people are going up , and i hear these things because i don &apos;t want to get them with it , or , 
so quantum mechanics says that evidence objects feel the same .
the companions for embady objects are not just people , but the light that seems to them , and the wind that &apos;s going on from them and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is related to quantum mechanically , we had to throw the whole corporate .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned the light , put it in a vacuum , and we said the entire air , and they were cooling it up to almost now , the piece of metal is free to behave like always wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
rather than it &apos;s just quiet there , vibrated it , the way it vibrated was about like this -- like an extending and together baseball .
in which we gave him a little piece , we were able to vibrate it at the same time and not to vibrate -- something allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is something that &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that the piece of metal is still , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
they &apos;re just precisive times they &apos;re concerned about .
the rest of the time is decocalized .
that means every atom at the same time is two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal is metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth including me for all this year in the clean room , because , consider that , the difference difference between a single atom and that piece of metal is about the difference between th
so if an individual atom at the same time can be two different places , this piece of metal can be metal in two different places , why isn &apos;t it also ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine you would be the same time in several places , what would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with that your body is delocalized in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we watched the light , and turned the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all of the objects on the elevation are just quantum objects that are driven in a small space together .
you hear a lot of talks about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind that , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should reconcepulate how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they give them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competitio
at the moment , we &apos;re far from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that aren &apos;t even a single city that they were welcoming .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more than it costs to build it .
so we could actually extract the world very simply with dozens , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now that sounds absolute for you , you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just trade the construction of the homes against the cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in apartments , that &apos;s already , the other half of the other half .
you could try to expand the capacity of the apartment that &apos;s already existing .
but you know what they were going to end up with , in these apartments and their environments to avoid the laws to avoid and distribute them .
so it turns out to be very difficult to get all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new residential building , provides the laws there would support one of these buildings and not disabled it .
so i proposed that governments create new surfaces that give enough place for a city , and give them a name : charter cities .
and later , i found that something about the same time , dave and octavio about the challenges of a reform in hondras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 hourdanars left their country , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same i
at this point , javiers said to octivia , &quot; what happens when we take an embassy surface of our country -- what if we just give them a message under the canadian regulations or the united state
in the summer of 2009 , honduras live under a curious constitution crisis .
in the next planning elections , pepp lobo would won in a commitment that programs promised both innovation and also simply .
he challenged octavio to become his staff .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , try and try through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city to reduce the essential elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t destroy existing apartments .
we &apos;re giving new technologies big conservation , but for progress , it needs technologies and laws , and they &apos;re usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala octavio , sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him for him .
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the chairman of our country . &quot;
so we met december in december of a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to do clearly , how valuable cities are , the way they &apos;re more valuable than they cost .
and i &apos;ve used this graph , to show how valuable rawand is in a place like new york , remember that a surface in some cases per square meter value is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , on a place when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk made a very simple shape that a charter city is a place that &apos;s uninhabited country , a founding contract that goes up there , and people &apos;s opportunity to decide to live in
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been asked by the president of hondrua , who meant that we have to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to get our country .
i was asked to come to techugalapa , and again , at the fourth and fifth january , asked a talk .
and so i thought another with fact filled talk , which has contained a graph like this that tries to explain that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of deneer , and the sketch provides the new airport that was built in denver .
alone of these airports has an area of 100 square kilometers .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hondurans if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand morning .
politically , all have applauded .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the head of congress came on the stage and has said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that a new city offers new possibilities .
there was the opportunity to live in a city that &apos;s in hondura , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leadership .
the leaders of the government in hondura would be dependent on the help of partner countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that they were going to support the laws for this chart
and the realization of president lobo , was that the certainty of the demand i thought about , as a way to get the foreign investors to build this city and build this city for all parties in hondura
we &apos;ve driven into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it really extensively thousands of square kilometers .
and shortly after that , on january , they have voted with congress for a constitution to have a constitutional constitution that &apos;s reliable for special developments .
in a country that &apos;s just behind a huge crisis behind that congress was elected with 144 to a voice .
all parties , all the fractions of society , supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , but it &apos;s twice through congress .
on the 17th of february , it became the second time with 114 to a voice .
immediately after this choice , between 21 and the 24th and the 24th , a delegation of about 30 hundreds to the two places of the world that were most interested in the business of cities .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that was built in south korea -- big than the city center of boston .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years after it took four years to get permissions .
the other place that was very interested in cities is singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re practically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already have a breakthrough , and they &apos;re already this surface for the second city .
it &apos;s already worked on a legal system that managers allowed to participate , and it &apos;s also worked on an external legal system .
one country has already offered to put his top court health as a court for the discovering system .
and cities designers and farmers are very interested in .
they &apos;re even bringing finance with one .
one of the things you &apos;ve already known was been explained , there &apos;s a lot of months .
there &apos;s a lot of operations that would like to introduce in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are lots of people who would like to live there .
all over the world , there are 700 million people who are suggesting that they like to live in another place .
one million people are leaving latin america and walk into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to look for their families , sometimes it &apos;s a single mother that have to make enough money to afford to eat and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s sometimes children who are trying to figure out their parents that , in some cases haven &apos;t seen their parents for a decade .
so what &apos;s an idea to think about thinking about this in honduras a completely new town ?
or even dozens of these cities , distributed hundreds around the world ?
so what &apos;s the idea of considering that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank yod .
do you know how many decisions are doing on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions are meeting in a typical week ?
i just recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions that provides a typical american on a day is 70 .
and also , recently , a study made with ceos where they were seeing the ceos a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different subjects documenting this ceo , and how much time they spent them to make decisions that come together with the subjects .
and they found that the average ceo would be employed in the week with 139 tasks .
each of these subjects , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were met within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions are meeting in the nine minutes of category across the one in one hour of category ?
how well , do you think they &apos;re the decisions about the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest decision-making problems of our modern times , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise you , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today : are you ready to hear something about the decision-making problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford , i went to this very exclusive food store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that &apos;s called it .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure park .
they had 250 different species of mustand eating and over 500 different kinds of frequents and vegetables and more than two dozen different ways of water -- and that was at a time we have actually d
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time , i wondered , &quot; well , how does it matter ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were including in boxes that came from thousand-year-old olive trees .
so one day i decided to visit the filial liver , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people &apos;s possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed on the burdings of tourists who came out every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to business an experiment , and we chose marmle for our experiment .
here &apos;s their marmigladen .
they had 384 different kinds of marmled .
we &apos;ve set up a little equipment corner directly at the end of the business .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes there marbled or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things -- first of all , i would stay with the case more people are standing and trying to t
there are more people standing when they were 24 , about 60 percent , as if they were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we saw in which people bought more likely a glass of marmalade .
now we saw the reverse effect .
from people who were staying when we were 24 , only three percent bought a glass of marmade .
from the people who stayed when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them were actually buying a glass of them .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times more of a glass of marmlades where they had six to the choice as if they had 24 to the choice .
well , not to decide to buy a glass of marmlades is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tails -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is affecting us in very conseq
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s going on against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now that i did with gue hubberman , my camenica , where we did the decisions to saving for the retirements of almost a million americans from about 650 plans in th
and what we &apos;ve looked at was if the number of foundations that were possible , which was possible , the 401 plan , the likelihood is affecting whether it &apos;s saved for the morning .
and what we found is that there was a context in fact .
in these plans , we had about 657 plans that provide the people between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more fonds were offered that , in fact , the more rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that operate two funds , a participation participation in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans , which almost 60 fonds , the participation participation fell on about the sixtyest percent .
now it turns out that even if they were participating in choices when more opportunities stood to choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more of the things that the more possibilities they were available , the more they provide it and choose them .
the more possibilities they were available , the more they put their entire money into pure money .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that somebody would recommend if their future financial well-being is important .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that brings the offer of more and more choices .
they pick up the decision -- shift up , even when it comes to their own best interest .
they meet more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide for things that they &apos;re even less happy , even if they &apos;re doing it better .
the main reason for this is that we may be enjoying these huge shelves of mayonasis , sense and marmades , but we can &apos;t draw the comparisons and distributions , and then actually choose someth
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways -- that you can just apply in your business .
first of all , limitation .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today that less more .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing down .
but in fact , we see it more and more that if they &apos;re willing to limit , and more that you &apos;re ready , and then there &apos;s an increase in selling , there &apos;s a rise of selling , it
as a procotor and gamble , the different head and shoulder &apos;s species of 26 , they experienced an increase in selling for 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation was going to 10 of the worst , they were experiencing that the profits increase by 87 percent -- a result of both , the increase of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average supermarket today , provides them 45,000 products .
a typical walmart provides 100,000 products .
but the ninthest supermarket , the ninthest supermarket in the world is aldi , and they only give them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of saving , i think one of the best examples that are recently coming to the market , about how to manage the choices , something that david labison has very strong , it &apos;s a p
every single harvard employed now automatically parts on a lifetime .
the ones that really want to meet a choice will offer 20 fonds , not 300 or more funds .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limite it .
it &apos;s all important opportunity . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m the employee question is , &quot; tell me how the opportunities are different from each other .
and if your employees they can &apos;t get their employees , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
well , before we started now , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to provide all the people in this audience in this audience to provide an all inclusive radiation to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read it , and after that , i &apos;m going to ask you to clap if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s offering .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to address gary &apos;s offer .
are that all ?f this ?
all right , let me show you something more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for that journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact that she &apos;s looking at objectively for the first time more than the second time , but i would like to reach it that they felt really at the second time .
because the images made it feel really for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the concretization .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities to understand that the consequences are associated with the individuals , and that these consequences have to be feeling ve
why do people give average 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ecc map or a credit card than bargetden ?
because it &apos;s not what we feel really money .
and it turns out that if you manage that something feels concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
so we &apos;ve got in a study that i did with shomo benarti and alessandro previtter , we &apos;ve done a study with people -- employees that all have worked for -- and these people were all in a co
and during that convention , we &apos;ve leaved this convention as it was always , we just added a little bit .
the little that we &apos;ve been doing is that we have asked the people , just thinking about all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money .
where we were doing this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save , or a rise to four percent on th
the third technology : categorization .
we can do better with more categories than with more choices .
for example , here &apos;s a study that we &apos;ve done in a magazine .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the wegan supermarkets up and down in the northeast , the number of 313 different kinds of magazines has up to 666 mewsages .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 mewsages , and i show it in 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and then you give you more choices , then you &apos;ve given you more choice and a better choice experienc
because the categories tell me how i can hold it apart .
here &apos;s two different descriptions .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; swin . &quot;
if you think the left sign is swing , and the display is right jazz , then you clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swinging , please clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the on the right is sing , but you know what ?
this is a highly useful categorization scheme .
the categories need to say something , not what the choice is providing .
and that problem is often , if you look at the long lists of all these funds .
who are you actually going to inform with it ?
my fourth technology : prediction for complexity .
it turns out we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the buy of a car .
here &apos;s a german writer that provides you the opportunity to configurate your car .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car .
now these decisions in the number of choices that provide per decision .
cars , outside the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , driven -- four opportunities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order where the choices appear .
half of the customers are going from the many possibilities , 56 cars to the low possibilities , four graves .
the other half of the clients goes from the low possibilities , four grivers , the 56 colors , many opportunities .
what do i look at ?
how do they &apos;re interested .
if you use the standard choice in the decision , that means that they &apos;re changed , the hotter , i &apos;ll lose it .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people who go from many of the low choices going over and over again the standard choice .
we lose them .
let &apos;s go from the little choices to many , then they stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is to change the order where this information is presented .
when i start with the simple start , i learn how i choose .
even though the gravity chooses , nothing about my preferences in the interior care , it &apos;s still providing me .
it also gives me in excitement about the great product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate me to motivate with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that match the problem of decision-making -- restrict -- they &apos;re going to concrete the overlosing alternatives , concrete -- we can deal with more cat
each of these techniques that i &apos;m describing to you today is to help you manage them to manage them , good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you provide service .
because i believe that the key to the best possible choice is that you &apos;re in the choice .
and the more we &apos;re choiceng , the better we &apos;ll be able to practice the art of decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin alloca , trend managers in youtube . professionally , i look at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we &apos;re going to talk about how video &apos;s viral are going to become viral , and that &apos;s why that &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrity , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so infinitely difficult .
but web videos allows that we all , or all of our creative activities can be insane famous in one part of the world &apos;s culture .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video per minute .
again , a tiny percentage ever becomes viral , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times , and that &apos;s the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemakers , parting communities and the unexpected .
well , then we want to want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
what !
hhhh , wow !
last year bear vasques sent this video that he was filming in front of his house in the yosemet national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was popular for the first time for the first time .
actually , bear &apos;s video didn &apos;t want to do viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re meaning yosemite mountain bear .
he had put a lot of nature videos .
and this video was actually been sent in january .
what happened here ?
there was jummy .
jimmy was sending the tweet that made the video last so popular .
because tastemakers like jimmy kill , imagine new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday , everybody &apos;s looking forward to the week , weight , friday , friday . you wouldn &apos;t have thought we would lead this entertainment without talking about this vi
rebecca blacks : friday &apos;s one of the popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it doesn &apos;t seem to be anything .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other spikes are also friday .
but what about that day , this particular friday ?
well , toshhi gave it up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was a first one that made a joke in twitter about it .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or group of tastemakers would take a standpoint with a large audience and speed up the process .
and then this community of people who shared this great individual , and started talking about playing with it .
now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friady &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single week .
unlike the one-personal entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading or something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
it became almost 50 million times this year .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version that was looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats to look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that &apos;s going on in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an ancient version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix community came out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate .
today , we &apos;re not just finding on something , we &apos;re going to do .
who could have been able to do this ?
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow , &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; ny
what three books could have write their writing that &apos;s going on ?
in a world where every minute of the minute is going to upload video , just really unique and unexpected like the mentioned videos .
i give , i wasn &apos;t really interested in me when a friend said i should look at this great video about a guy who protested in new york in new york against the bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i wasn &apos;t driving on the way , but often there are disabilities that are not recently driving .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey never became the funny idea and his argument for five million times .
this approach comes for everything that we &apos;re doing .
and that &apos;s all leading us to the great question ...
what does that mean ?
hhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemakers , creative participants , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that has access to each access and where the audience determines popularity .
as i said , one of the most currently biggest -- justin beeber -- made his beginning on youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
and today , we all feel as property of our pop culture .
and these aren &apos;t the features of the old media , and they &apos;re also little to the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i came together in 10 minutes about the connection between women around three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connection is manifested in a four-year-old girl &apos;s life
the story is not yet over .
she &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his lifetime .
it &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of his home and freedom of his home was held together .
hold it into the introduction of the communists in saigon in front of how he needs to really mean that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , now his friends .
he moved into the silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother has never forgotten me his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story tried to crush us , we &apos;ve been observing it .
the next puzzle shows how a boat in the early morning red joint to the early morning rod .
my mother was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , he had a task her : the flight of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely exclusive that it could fail .
after a four-year-old and film reef saga , there &apos;s a boat silent on the sea as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risk .
they had the biggest fear from pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was a little poison on the boat .
in a prisoner , my sister and i had drink themselves and my grandmother of it .
my first memories are from this boat -- the strange tucker of the engine , the clapping of any wave on the bug , the far and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came a lot of times , but let &apos;s develop from the death of the men on our boat , or the following of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start six hours
but i remember the lights of the oil platform from the malaysic coast , and the young man who broke together and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple
no apple has ever tasted .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbournes .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations that are together to build a new life .
we let us down to photoscray , one of the working class that population is made of immigrant layers .
in other things that were in the opposed middle-class boards whose existence was completely unknown , there was no assembly thinking .
the smells from the leaders came from the rest of the world .
and the final broken english had been exchanged between people who had one thing : they started .
my mother was working on the farms , then on a flood in a car factory , six days , double layers .
it &apos;s sort of , somehow , to find the time to share english and and qualifications .
we were poor .
every dollar has been shared , and i was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to deal with , mostly the new thing that came from the second hand .
two couples of structures for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a school unform until the knobs , because she had to go into six years .
and there were the rare painful choires of &quot; slick eyes , &quot; and here and there &apos;s talking , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
home where ?
something went into me .
there was a meeting for reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sleep in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job every night to stay away until their nights came so that i could have them up .
she opened a computer business , then made a cosmetic education and opened one business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t get the change , angry and inflexible , and worried children , captured between two worlds .
loans and sponsors have been looked .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one thing , i was the classic asian student , which asked incredible demands on himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in unsecure lifes , the tragic stations of violence , drug abuse and isolation .
but so many of them helped over the years .
and because of that help , i &apos;ve been picked up in my last year of juartism as a young australian of the year .
and i was going from a puzzle to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous residents from footral , was now tan , refugees and social activist that was invited to talks to places that never heard of , and in homes that their existence they could never ha
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the editor .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the passion .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the context of the life of an unknown suburban -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters that told each other the stories of their day and include , we sti
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she remembered me that i was so old then when we got the boat .
no , never had an opportunity .
&quot; do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about juveniless and education , and the neglection of the marginalized and discovered .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the lives , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t give me with a career in jura .
there had to be a different piece of puzzle .
and i recognized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a new commitment , new in the image -- and not only , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
because it can lead to the collapse of the horizon , it can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my convenience area to know that yeah , the world is appropriate , but not just how to fear it .
opportunities that wouldn &apos;t have been encouraged .
there was an energy , an inconvenient optimism , a strange mixture of humble and the display .
so i followed my feeling .
and i collected a little team of people around me , for the debt , &quot; doesn &apos;t get an incredible challenge .
a year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of the end of every day , i cooked a huge top of soup that we shared .
we were working up to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliants , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the united states .
after a trip there .
my feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure went forward .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when confuciaism was the social norma and the local mandarin the most important person .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after your birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a mandar , whose mother became them .
without supporting her man &apos;s worried , she worried them for a sense by bringing him in front of the court and in their own case , and an even larger sensation when she won .
&quot; doesn &apos;t work &quot; doesn &apos;t work .
i &apos;ve just picked up in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbournes .
i looked through the pinches and looked at them on the other side .
i knew it was coming , to pass themselves .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in footscare and sat around their saring .
we told their stories , and we assured them that we were still their way .
and the middlight came to the monk and said he &apos;s got to close the sarge .
my mother asked us to fit your hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding you for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , then it &apos;s going through the women .
if you look at who we were , and how life shaped us , we can see that the men who would have come in our lives we would have come into the coors .
the defeat would have been too simple .
i &apos;d like to think of my own children , and i think of the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privileges , from light , in front of the rights .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courage of every wave , the unstructive , stick duckers of the motor , the far horizon , who didn &apos;t guarantee nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and get them safe , i would do it .
also , tan &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography at all ?
because , of course , that &apos;s a picture you can &apos;t record with your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography started when i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 years .
i combined it with my former preferences for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera was really in planning .
and when you take a picture with a camera , ends the process when you press on the degradation .
so for me , in photography seemed to be more likely to go on the right place at the right time .
i believed , everybody can do that .
and so i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trigger is pressed .
photos like this : a building site along a much danger street .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and yet a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and colorful , but all of the common goals to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really catch , but i &apos;d like to let it look like this , on a photo .
photos where you have to think a little moment that you have to think about , to find out the trick .
so it &apos;s more really about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be tangible at a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i look at them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfect imaginable physical objects that we &apos;re all identificating in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that looks still three dimensions as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re listening our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture of realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , things around us around us .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise , they just see wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic result .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but combines something special as this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined the same illumination way .
and these two pictures are fulfilling these two demands -- from the same high and the same lighting thing .
thirdly , it &apos;s impossible to distinguish where the individuals are starting and ending by connecting them standardly .
makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually composed to .
so by coloring color , contrast and lightness in the edges of the edges of the individuals , photographic lacks , how fields , colored colors and disorders , we &apos;re going to look the limitation
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom has been manipulated .
and this picture is actually completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely comp
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to take compromises with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on an angerous flight .
this is from another place .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
and , you know , i even killed the house up on the island of red to make it look swedish .
to achieve a realistic result , it goes out of myself on planning .
i &apos;m always starting with a sketh , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s the combination of different pictures .
and here &apos;s each piece very well .
and when you make good recordings , the result can be pretty beautiful and also pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that limites us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects are failing .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced at the radboud university was to do a main listening .
and she doesn &apos;t get particularly scientific -- she &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how does it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems that all -- maybe most of the electronic health projects failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my wina car . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button , one .
and every morning i &apos;ll jump on that .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve been setting my task at 95 percent .
it works very simple : every time i jump on the car , she sends my data as well at google health .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re also calling up from my device so you can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment when i need cardiological support or so , but with a look at the p
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 flowers on twitter .
so every morning , i &apos;m jumping on my wlan chart , and people talk to me , before i sit in the car , &quot; lunch longer just a small salad today , lucien . &quot;
but that &apos;s the nice thing that can happen because it &apos;s the group process to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it could be used to smoke .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs and get them to play any kind of game to control their health better .
next week , that &apos;s on the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little blood pressure that you &apos;re looking at an iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure , sending it to their doctors and share it to others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients come into the game . they can not only take control of control , being captains on their own ship , but also can help us health care view of the challenges that are befo
they make methods that are easy to use , and they begin with this one to embrace patients in the team .
and that &apos;s what they can do through these methods , but also through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all of the monitoriats are around mastery .
we know another one where all the danging stations are .
and clearly , we can find fast food chain .
but where would the next add to help this patient ?
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving ade was at that moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website and asked a crowd mass , &quot; if you see an ade , please share us where he is when he &apos;s , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business , of course .
and over 10,000 ades , they were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
and we &apos;ve designed an ipad app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for yaar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like mastrict and someone can use together , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , your microsoft cell phone to find the next aed that can save life .
and today , we don &apos;t want to just want to do this as aeedu , as the product is called but as an aedus .
and we want to bring this into a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , around helping us behave like node points to behave these aeds all over the world .
and if you &apos;re in holidays and somebody else is your own relationship or somebody else , you can find that way .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us at the confirmation of these aeds .
these could be curier services , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the participated ade is still at their place .
please help us , and try to improve the health of not just something , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little startup wants us to force the environmental protection by it .
well , it &apos;s going to look at the crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it &apos;s perhaps before it &apos;s headed .
well , we can just display that -- i &apos;m just going to jump the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , taking one year and work in an environment that is pretty everything they hate , we &apos;ve worked in the govern
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like peace corps for computer feaks .
we elect some fellows every year , and we &apos;re working on with cities .
instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re sending them into the third world .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what you really do is to show what technology is possible today .
so they meet all .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
here it looks like searching for a data , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s freely with him , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good in the brand show when he &apos;s been r
how did he be looking for this special kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , the code for america &apos;s code for america .
they were there in the february , and it &apos;s been a lot of fabruary last february .
and they realized that the city never breaks these hydratts .
but a particular fellow , a man named errich michaels &apos;s ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were strucking up the sidewalks , directly in front of these .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt an hydratton .
you &apos;re trying to shake it from him when it &apos;s switching .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first one .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows have written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do another government technology .
it spreads rasically .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu , who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but so the citizens to adopt tsunami sires .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the classed gulles .
and chicago has just introduced her so that people who have the business dries when it &apos;s sustained .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it &apos;s friendly spread , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you don &apos;t normally know it &apos;s not like that .
the software is going to take a few years in the rule .
we had a team that worked on a project last year at a project for three people two and a half months .
it was about a method with parents that are the right public schools for their children .
we were told later that if it would go over the normal channels it took over two years , and it cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s now a project in the californian justice that the taxpayers have been two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on each level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spreads from themselves , is a kind of shot in front of the government &apos;s institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not even like a technology company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation , which takes the problem of the government -- not as the problem of collective institution , but as a problem of collective ac
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to put things effectively in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people across the country that stand up and writing government apps , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all feelings about politics and the lines to work , and all the other things we &apos;re really exciting about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o 
today , a lot of people have given up government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , ask you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately creates their force from us -- remember the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how that change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought that the government is probably about people to choose .
now after two years , i came to conclusion that it &apos;s especially communities to go .
this is the call center for service and information .
that &apos;s where you get out in your city 111 .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in your urban call centers , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- actually , they all do -- you &apos;ll see that people , the governmen
so scott gets this call .
he tips &quot; the journal &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s starting with the animal catcher .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if that &apos;s looking down ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the journals .
boston has not just a call center .
it has an app , a web and cell phone called &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is very smart people in the office of the new urban mechanics office in boston .
one day -- that &apos;s actually an actual report -- came in , &quot; contribution in my waste class . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them removed ? &quot;
but what &apos;s happening to &quot; citizen connect &quot; is different .
scott is talking about human to human .
but in citizen connect , is all public so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next thing we got is , &quot; i went over there , &quot; i found the waste town behind the house .
contribution ? yes . alive ? yeah .
turned on the page . went home .
good night , sweet doad . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role .
she connected these two people .
and you could have connected them with state performances if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
when a neighbor of the other , we strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call the animals , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it is that government is not the same politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contributions to the system is choosing .
how often , we &apos;ve chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we return , and we expect that the government reflects our valu
that &apos;s because the government is like another ocean , and politics are the most commodities .
and what &apos;s below underneath is what we call bureaucraci .
and we &apos;re using this word with such conservation .
but it &apos;s this condition that we own , and for what we pay for , which is working against us , something else , and then we took ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government happens .
we need to get into the machinery of government .
so the occupyphesic movement has done .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of worried citizens that has written a very detailed 325-page report , which is an answer to the sex memo about the law of financial reform .
that &apos;s not politically active , that &apos;s active .
now , for those of us who gave up government , it &apos;s time that we want to think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we need to achieve without improving an institution that can act in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it must become efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible for the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something that can actually reach the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and that knows it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build only really systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with seeing their voice for granted .
they don &apos;t fight this struggle that we &apos;re all fighting about , who can talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can except their opinion , on every channel at any time , and they &apos;re doing it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care about using their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improves the work of the government .
and these apps lets us use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be being able to stretch a hydratton , writer to have a waste watch with a deal rate .
and certainly , we would have been out of these hydrants all the time , and a lot of people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers governments that pay and receive the performance .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i have for you all here : when it goes around the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a l
thank you .
normally , my role is telling people how wonderful the new technologies that are out , and i thought , because i &apos;m here below friends , i would tell you what i &apos;m really thinking , and to
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... could you please show the slide .
this is a slide that i happened to chose from my order .
i &apos;m not about the details of the slide , but rather than the general shape .
this slide shows an analysis of the performance of risk processors compared to the performance of a local area network .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some others , which we often meet in our field , some way on a semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the power scale .
and that &apos;s a note that we have to use this guy scale to semi-logarithmic curves in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could please put the lights again .
a little bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology of semi-logarithmic curves ?
and the reason is , if i draw it into a normal curve , where , say , these are the years , so the times of a type of technology , which i want to do with a graph , then the graph will be silly .
and then they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , that would be very distributed on the semi-logarithmic scale , it would be really unreasonable in the for
but when this happens like this , then this changes the qualitative conditions .
so if the transportation technology would progress so fast as the microprocessor technology would progress , we could increase in a taxi , and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
this was never before in the history of technology , this kind of recursive growth through which scale scale is exponentially increasing every few years .
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you see , they don &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything evolves forever and forever as quickly as now .
there are two options .
either , it &apos;s going to be a classic structure like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen .
that &apos;s something .
well , i &apos;m optimist , so i think it &apos;s going to happen in the way here .
it &apos;s really like that , that means we &apos;re here right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the overall world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i often ask myself , is this new world is going to be ?
what &apos;s this new state that the world takes slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere at the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now here &apos;s a conference where people talk about the future , and you find that the future still lies at 2000 .
that &apos;s not that we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future has scrubbed a year since i &apos;ve been in this world .
and i think the reason is that we realize that something &apos;s going on .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that there &apos;s no sense to look at 30 or 50 years to look into the future , because it &apos;s going to be so different that there &apos;s a very simple high target of what we &apos;
so i &apos;d like to talk about what this might be , this transition that we &apos;re right now .
to make this first , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go back a step back and look at this thing on a long time sale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at the earth &apos;s life &apos;s life .
i think the entire picture makes sense , if you split it into some billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s about 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , sterile stone line with many of them floating chemicals .
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then this gives us a pretty good image about how they did .
i think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of which is that at that time , little oil spills 
some of these oil droppeds had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and growing it to grow .
everybody who were like this , started to give up .
these little oil droplets were in the sense the most primitive cell form .
however , these oil spills were not like alive in today , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have distributed chemicals to inequal chemicals .
so every drop is a little bit different .
in fact , the droplings grew up , which one for the growth of optimilar composition had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so these tended to survive longer , and they were restructing in bigger .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interestingly , if these droples learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we haven &apos;t really understood , these droplets have learned the ability to despend information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the cell as an information , and in a certain chemical shape , which we call dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found a way in this mental , evolutionary way that allowed them to write what they were able to write , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store over the time of two and a billion years , where they were emerged in the same time .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly same code and the same writing .
and every creature uses the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re like that we can only write the pleasure purpose of writing themselves in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micrograms of a white powder that i &apos;ve been trying to keep in airports from security .
and it &apos;s -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i wrote my visiting map on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written 10 to 22 tim
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my visit card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have been a selfish , i would have written them on a virus and give them up in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna was an interesting step .
and then these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step happened where things were completely different , and that &apos;s because these cells began to communicate and exchange information that communities from cell
i don &apos;t know if you already knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , is growing the constitution to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how they can stay from penicillin and wrote this information with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , be
this communication now allowed the reasons of communities that were in some sense , they were synergetic .
so they either survived together , or they went together , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more often repeated and preferred by evolution .
the transition is there where these communities broke so close together , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have multicellular communities , communities of many different cell types , which are functioning together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multi-cell community .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer asked on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started developing , so that the level that evolution was , no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organisms .
the next step happened now within these communities .
the cells started abstracting information again .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t make anything else as the information within organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are information processing that these cells communities have built .
they started training specialists within the community , particular structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and sticking from information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that time , an individual -- now learning is happening within the period of a single organism , rather than about these evolutionary time .
so one organism , for example , learned to eat a certain fruit because she tasted and made him sick , the last time he eated her .
this could now happen within the lifespan of an individual lifestyle , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned about the individuals that died because of 
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with these particular information structures , because evolution could now have in an individual .
and she could happen within a time-learning learning .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the most refined us version of this communication is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated here , extraordinary and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and give basically basically basic sounds of me in hope to create a similar to create ideas in your head that has a certain kind of similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , transform it in sounds , a sequence of sounds , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work as a unified organism .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we , humanity , is we started abstracting .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that have been doing through major cellorganisms -- the abstraction of our methods that we hold data .
the invention of the language , for example , was a little step in that direction .
telephone , computers , computers , cd romes , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to have this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much larger , and it &apos;s able to continue to develop faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen the small evolution of where he showed a little evolution in convolution in convolution , directly in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the time came again .
the first steps of the story that i told you , one billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the next step , like language , and so on , less than one million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
the process feeds on itself and becomes , i think , i think , catalytic is the word for -- when something increases his change speed .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
we see the process that feeds from itself .
i &apos;m living professionally from computers , and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently progress in computing technology .
my recent activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what makes every single transistor in the connection machine .
it has billions of them .
what i &apos;m doing instead , and whatever the designers of thinking machines is doing , we think of a certain abstraction level , and the machine makes something that &apos;s overwhelming , better
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand really .
a method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and that i &apos;ve been used in the last time is evolution itself .
and we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond .
in order to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that develops from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generate a hundred million accidental sequences of instructions .
now , all of these randomly elected instructions are leading all the programs , and eventually choose the people who are the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort numbers , this would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for it .
so find programs that can do the most pleast numbers .
of course , the chance of random instructions is very small that they &apos;re going to sort the number of numbers , so none of the instructions are actually doing this .
but one of the things that likes with some happiness with two numbers into the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , now take these 10 percent of the sequences , which are the next one .
memorize these , delete the rest .
now reproduces all of the rest that the numbers were best .
and with a method of recording , analog for reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their suburotines , and the children are assembling the features of the sub-routines from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that come together something closer than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
govern them again .
maybe some mutations lead .
and that &apos;s another generation trying .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through an evolution for millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or in more complicated cases , a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can sort the numbers perfectly .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i &apos;d ever write about hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
i tried to understand it .
it &apos;s contract and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that you &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , when he pulls on a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , this airplane is hundreds of thousands of small parts , which work together to make their flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t that make you more confident ? &quot;
we know that a development process is not optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers , for a process that &apos;s different from classical engineering engineering .
he allows us to produce things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the opportunities .
so , in some ways , the technology is going to flow .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these processes even faster .
so there &apos;s a feedback .
it becomes faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be so confusing .
because all of these new technologies from today from themselves .
we &apos;re doing up .
we &apos;ve been at a point that &apos;s analog to that time , as an individual organism have developed to multicell organisms .
so we &apos;re the attacks , and we can &apos;t do it yet , what the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
but i really believe that after us get something else .
i think it &apos;s very highly to say that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
well lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m hearing here , before i &apos;m still elected .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was underneath the stars in the desert with sufi singer mukticiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the ancient indian epos since the ancient indian epos , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in that time , we jumped into a car and switches across the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
back then , when the great indian warrior prince had the store , he took one bow , shot in the ground and water .
now we &apos;re going to do this with drillers and machines .
we came up with the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got something scared of technology .
i made me fear that i could lose the ability to lose the sunset without camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not killing magic .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world of pirates and incredible ships and images in my idea .
and i came up with this , like our sending clocks and cameras were dreaming about it .
they stopped being inspired by this .
and so i got into the world of technology to see how i could use them magic instead of killing magic .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling readers around the world .
it can know how we think .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing images and text , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling needs more and more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- this is saying , &quot; this box heard -- &quot; i write my name .
and it &apos;s going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s really addressed .
the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean that magicians and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found very exciting .
that &apos;s how you have to kepp the ipad kipping out the fireflies .
and they light up through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated with me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can stick in a single multer .
and that &apos;s why every book , every book , and each world is going to pull a little muttle that i &apos;m going here in the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books had always maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and glows and serves to orientation in the rest of the book .
it also shows other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s important to me to create something that indian is also very time .
these are the aspaas .
we &apos;ve heard all of feen and nymphen , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the appaases ?
the poor asparas were caught in indras thousands of years in an old moving book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary story for children .
one story that &apos;s considered with new issues like the environmental crisis .
the theme environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms sit without going out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;ll send on a search . you have to go out and collect with the ipad &apos;s picture of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , stones , pills and clams .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this is brought back childhood ritual . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower .
in another chapter , you &apos;ve got to photograph a piece of trees into the chapter .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos you can then put online online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fine and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a foot . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
and that creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually did .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan an interaction where you use the video of the ipad , and through augmented reality , we see an animation of elf that appears on a plant in front of the house .
on a place , the screen is filling with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the wind , you &apos;ve got to read away and read the rest of the book .
we all move into a world where the natural forces of technology come together and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in exploration , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the most socially weakest in the social destructions and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
here at ted , to see and listen to how stimulating that is , has given me a lot of force .
in the short time here , i realized : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and power that it didn &apos;t .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s meaning , but that the words of an engaged teacher &apos;s particularly meaningful .
as a doctor you can do good . as a careful doctor , but you can do even more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african american household that was dominated by a matriarch , and this matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a methon , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in each family .
she was also the starting point of many arguments in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in virginia in the 1840s in virginia as slaves .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed their world is very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little young boy , she came up to me and gathered me .
she pushed me so fight that i couldn &apos;t breathe , and then she left me .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and when i said , &quot; no . &quot; she would get me again . when i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; she left me in quiet .
they were something that did something that you wanted to be close to your close .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of your to the children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins all around .
i remember i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and started .
first , i thought this was a game .
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came over to me . she took me at the hand , and she said , &quot; come , bryan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember that it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise you &apos;re not talking about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promise , oma .
she said , &quot; honor word ? &quot; i said , &quot; oh . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to watch you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special .
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , bryan .
i said , &quot; okay . oma .
she said , &quot; well , first promise you &apos;ll always love your moma . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to care about them . &quot;
i took my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
and then she said , &quot; next you &apos;re always going to do the right thing : &quot; even though it &apos;s difficult to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; well , om . i promise it . &quot;
after all , she said , &quot; the last thing you promise me is &quot; that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; oh , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and one year of younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixpack beer with my sister and me and went to the forest .
we also studied there like anything else there .
and then he took a sweet beer and offer of my sister , and she took , and then they offered me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s okay . just don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to do that today , you also do everything we &apos;re doing .
i had what , your sister had what . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just make you . &quot;
my brother started me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s because with you ? now drink well .
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still make you crazy because of ama ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you talk about ?
he said , &quot; okam tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed .
i &apos;m going to stand you something .
i shouldn &apos;t do this .
this is perhaps transmitted publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s virtue . i say that because it means because identity means .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us , what they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all of their grandmothers , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the prison in prison .
my uncles died of alcoholenculdused diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we need to take .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in constitutions and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest incarceration rates in the world .
seven million people released or condition .
in my opinion , mass inhabitations have changed our world .
in social weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one out of three male blacks between 18 and 30 is happiness , in prison , release or with conditional strength .
in urban communities , everywhere in the country -- los angeles about philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men are either in prison , in prison , or with condition
but our system is not only being shaped by questions that have race of race , and it &apos;s going to design through poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that she &apos;s much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , influences the results .
and yet we seem to be satisfied .
a politics of fear and gentleman convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some highly interesting developments .
my home state of alabama does the right that you &apos;re going to be continuously convicted .
here , and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population has lost their electricity .
we predict that in 10 years , the question of the distinction of the civil hour rights is going to be as high as the prospective of the selective law .
the silence is silence .
i get children .
a lot of my manders are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that convicted three-year-old children death in prison .
in this our country , there are children &apos;s living sentences without confident .
we already have a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i get people in death cells .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe that because it taught us that the real question is : has a human being earned to die for one of him ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other sense is not , has somebody made death for a crime , but , have we deserved to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america defines through error .
in nine people we &apos;ve encountered , one that we &apos;ve found for innocent , which was released and out of the death .
an amazing mistake . one in nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never leave somebody with an airplane if for nine airplanes that are dropping off one .
but somehow we &apos;re going to create this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach african-american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time against the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about that .
but for the african americans in this country , it was a time of terroris .
in many areas , people had to fear lynchmbos .
or bome bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; me , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking about the people that they &apos;re going to stop to say that we &apos;ve got to do 
they say , &quot; no , say people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the race separation and decades of the racistic motivated support and apartheis .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand the meaning of our data in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly constantly .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to close to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the race rate is not to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany across the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply distribution to hear them . &quot;
he said , &quot; germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , they never give them in germany .
it &apos;s been very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever going to talk again for the systematic kills of people .
it would be conscious about us , conscious and people .
i thought about it .
how it would feel like to live in a world where the german state left people , especially when it would be a lot of jews .
it would be unbearable .
it would be conscious .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we set people -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted of death , when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher when the victim knows that
and yet , there &apos;s this mental application .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these hard topics , the positives and wonderful things are affected with .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities are overlated by suffering , abuse , devastation , excitement .
i &apos;m important to unite both .
because ultimately , we &apos;re talking about what we need more hope , more engagement , more commitments to consist in a complex world .
for me , the time means to bring thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantages that will never be at ted .
but think about a way that &apos;s integrated in our own life .
we all need to believe in the end of things that we can &apos;t see .
we &apos;re doing this . so rational we are , so much we estimate intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head heart connection that i believe is driving us , not only for all the lights and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
valcav havel , the great checical politician , once said .
when we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to be all sorts of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be a hopeless plac
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe that the ted communities have to engage .
there is no distriction about technology and design that allows us to be and human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , excitement and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity as a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i had the great privilege of meeting rosa parks .
woman parks always came back to montogemy , where she met two oldest friends , these older women , johnny car , who organized the montogery busboxyto -- an incredible african american -- and virgini
so these women were metting and talked about it .
and then woman car , then went to the city and said , &quot; brana , woman parks to the city . we want to talk about .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , very love . &quot;
she said , &quot; what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listened to .
it was always inspiring , so finishing .
one day i sat there and heard these women , and after a few hours , woman parks turned to me about us , &quot; well , bryan , tell me what &apos;s the unitiative for the same thing .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do against injustice .
we want to help people who were innocently convicted .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the strining system .
we want to create life-life sentences without conditional conditions for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to get the number of peers .
we want to create mass infants . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and then she said , &quot; mmmh . mmmm . mmm .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then car showed up to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s why you have to be very , very picker . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i believe that the ted community should be cheater .
we need to find ways to put these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst things we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s going to get every person on the planet .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a person .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because it &apos;s like this , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i believe that in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that , although it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring , and so exciting , we don &apos;t end up with our technology , not on the things that we develop , not on our intellect a
eventually , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but what they &apos;re treating with the poor , the convictions , the convictions .
because in this context , we &apos;re just starting to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose the balance . it &apos;s a story to the end .
sometimes i get too much .
i &apos;m going to tire how we all all .
sometimes these ideas are predicting our thinking , in a very important way .
i gave these children who were convicted to very hard sentences .
i go to the study prison and visit a mandant that may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s supposed to be as adults as adults .
and then i asked myself , how could that happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at it as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , when a judge can transform us to something else , then he has to have magic forces .
right , brian , the judge has magic forces .
you should also be what you &apos;re wishing .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think about right , i started working on a construction .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys as a mandand .
and i started with this position . the overcome said , &quot; contribution , my poor , 14-year-old black mandands like a privileged , white , 75 year-old top manager . &quot;
and in my response , i explained that the mistakes of the state and the police and the police and the process of the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , nothing more right is that there &apos;s just missing .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know whether i &apos;d been dreaming this crazy attitude or written him .
and to my description , i had not only written him , but sent to the court .
a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to talk to the court and this crazy case .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i drove to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car , and i went out of the stairs up .
when i went up to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the people in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyers ? &quot; and i said , &quot; you know . &quot;
he came up with me and engaged me .
and he then weighed me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
and i have to say it gave me force .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability of every single one to contribute to a community to a perspective of hope .
well , i entered the court .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , have you asked this crazy assignment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; oh , &quot; and then we started discussing .
and more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and depressing states and office workers .
it was the courage of the course of people who were angry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye angle , i saw the jastor and go .
he always looked back through the window , and he could hear the whole touhadh hearing .
he went up and down .
eventually , this older black man came with a very worried facial expression in the court room , and put directly behind me , almost to the defense bank .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
and during the break , a police barrier came in which it turned out that the people was in the country .
this deput ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do they do in the rights ?
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deutu , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m come from saying this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apo
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral community of the universe is going far , but that it &apos;s the justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as human rights , as long as we care about human rights and basic values .
that our survival is connected to survival every single one .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design for entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who see that , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
they have seen an obvious wish , this community , and heard them and help them do something and doing something .
what can we do ?
bray stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a people &apos;s spring in this spring , where it &apos;s actually about business , something from the money electricity that flows into the politics of pun
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars for death penalty in the next five years . a billion dollars in the next five years .
and yet , 46 percent of the killing delices didn &apos;t do with an arrastment .
56 percent of the rape cases don &apos;t come in front of the court .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this reference is going to suggest that money into more security forces and security .
i believe there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate in america is declined .
this fact is often asked in a relationship with the increased increased numbers .
what would you tell someone who believed it ?
well , in fact , the number of violence crimes haven &apos;t quite changed .
most of the massive inhabitations in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of violence .
it was the miscuited production against drugs .
and that &apos;s why the dramatic high pays come in the prison sites .
we &apos;ve been surrounding ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we &apos;ve got three people &quot; laws that people bring people forever behind grids , for a bicycle theft , for the theft , for the theft , instead of giving them back to the victims .
i think we have to do more to help people who &apos;ve become victims of the design , not less .
and i don &apos;t believe that our current position philosophy doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you &apos;ve really brought a string here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .

oh my god .
so these are just a couple of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects , because our minds give exactly these subjects .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses are starting to process much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because nothing is more important than our survival , the first supplies for all the information is part of our temporal lobes , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our danger detector .
it sorts off , and throughout the information on the search for every difference of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; when bt &apos;s blood , the demand is very true .
well , with all of our digital devices that seven days a week , the week of these negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but potentially , that &apos;s not the case .
possibly that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it &apos;s going to be possible for the next three decades to create a world of th
well , i &apos;m not saying we have no big problems -- climate crisis , water and energy problems -- we have .
and as human beings , we are much better at predicting problems in very long term , but they &apos;re eventually overcoming .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century so that we can predict the development .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubling the inflation of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has reduced about a tenth .
and that &apos;s that the nutrition , electricity transportation and communication costs have reduced a multiple .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re now living in a very peaceful time of human history .
and according to charles kenny , the alphabetization rate in the last 130 years in the last 130 years has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
remember , a great percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , waters , toilets , televisions , televisions , conditioning and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the imperators of the earth would never have dreamed like luxury goods .
the foundation for many of them is forming technologies , and these grows expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to be information technology in the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the price performance quality is doubling every 12 to 24
that &apos;s why the cell phone in their pocket is a million times less and is thousands of times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things about this curve .
first of all , how smooth it goes -- in good like in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high connection .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow up for any of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic location on the left , she &apos;s going to go up .
so the growth rate itself accelerates .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends at autodesk call &quot; infinite computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , synthetic biology , fuels , digital medicine , nano-mate
how many of you have seen the victory of ibms supercomputer watson for &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was great .
i took through the newspapers , and i &apos;ve been looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this one , &quot; watson &apos;s human existence . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of a mobile phone is available .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i here at ted started a new university that &apos;s called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students , companies , products and services that can influence the lives of billions of people within a decade .
think about it , a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can provide a dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
when i think about creating surplus , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on the planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating surplus of goods .
it &apos;s contextrally context , and technology is a resource of limiting force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napaleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silver pieces , napoleons themselves got gold passes .
the king of siam started getting aluminum pieces .
aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet , valuable than gold and plate .
this is why the dome of the washington monuments had been made from aluminum .
although aluminum takes 8.3 percent of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicate .
but then the technology of electrolysies were developed and made aluminum manufacturing that we &apos;re using it with our disposable mentality .
and then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with 5,000 times more energy than we use a year .
16 tearatts of energy , all eight minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
and that year , it &apos;s been able to reduce the cost of solar streams in india to reduce 50 percent of the dial stream -- 88 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy was 50 percent last year .
last month , it &apos;s published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the u.s. solar energy six cents per who is going to cost in the national average of the average .
and if we have an energy surplus , we &apos;re going to have water overload .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
remember , as carl sagan , the voyager spacecraft in 1990 , when it came out on saturn , rotated back towards earth ?
he took a famous picture . how did it mean ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet which is 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent saltwater , two percent are united , and we &apos;re fighting about 5.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
these are new nanotechnologies on the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation today this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the iot of the yoursolf , i want to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his technology that &apos;s calle
it can create a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all of that for less than two cents per liter .
the head of coca-cola has just been involved to start a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything &apos;s going on , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is going to apply this technology global in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology supported innovation that is today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you my goodness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent discovery rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just remember that a massai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication that has president reagan 25 years ago .
and when you search with your smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world that has information and communications , as nobody could have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousands of dollars -- gps , d video and photos , libraries of the books and music , technology to medical diagnosis --
and the best thing is potentially what expects us in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure to announce the so-called &quot; 10 million qualtom tricordr x prize . &quot;
we ask teams around the world , all these technologies to connect to each other in a cell phone that you can talk to the device because it &apos;s with kii , you can test ricests or your bloods .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnostic than a team of highly qualified doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease load and 1.3 percent of the collaborators of health care .
if this device sequences a rana or dna virus that &apos;s not familiar with , it &apos;s going to get the healthcare and prevents a pandemic in front of their outbreak .
but now the biggest power that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of surplus .
i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are standing for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 70 billion brands .
and just by the way , the greatest involvement against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition around the world .
in 2010 , we had online under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re previously two on five billion internet users .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before , are going to connect to the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
and instead of economic graduation , i see one of the greatest economic addictions of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier , and they become better trained by the khan academy , and that they will have the opportunity to use 3d printers and &quot; infinite computing , &quot; a
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of human community bring us us ?
how about a sentence , never before .
how about whatever you are , wherever you are , to give a voice to make it attention and create change , for the very first time ?
what will these three billion people will bring ?
how about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned from through the six prizes is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus , things that great companies and governments could only create in 
i want to conclude with a story that really excited me .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
it &apos;s a game called the fold .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
ever after his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors .
and they &apos;re now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern recognition better than folds the proteins than the best supercomputers .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best protein order of the world , this wasn &apos;t a mit professor , somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working at the day
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we &apos;ve got more than individuals to provide the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropis .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something against a change piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medicine , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in business that i can allow me to give up a piece of my own wrong prestige to enable this .
but before i come to the actual subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the seasonal close and we &apos;re moving to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball , &quot; soon and turns to statistics , and to use these to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic which i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the average performance of the battle .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a battle beats 300 .
that means that the player suggests three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s called the ball in the forestry , he comes up , he &apos;s not going to catch , and who tried the ball to throw the first base , it didn &apos;t do it just and the runner was in securit
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300ter in major league baseball ?
well , really , maybe an all star .
you know how to call a 400th ?
that &apos;s somebody in the rest of the course of 10 .
legendary -- like ted william &apos;s legendary -- the last major league player who met over 400 times during a regular season .
let &apos;s transform back into medicine where i &apos;m feeling or maybe a little bit less that i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
if you &apos;ve got a blind protection , and they &apos;re going to prove to an operator , that average performance is 400 in terms of blind preservations .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved people with closted heart visuals , and their hossen drives them to a cardiologist whose average performance of the average perfo
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the increasing ast .
and she &apos;s suggesting a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think about the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birth shelfer , should be a rescue ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what should be a good surgeon or rescue .
but what we do is that we &apos;re including each of them , including me to be perfectly in the world .
never make a mistake , but nobody &apos;s going to think about the details how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i recorded in medical school .
i was an obsessive student .
in the high school has told a student that brian goldman was going to learn for a blood test .
and that &apos;s what it was .
and i learned in my little happiness in the nurses residentiation at the toronto general hospital , unfortunate from here .
i learned everything .
and in my antomy school , i learned the origins and the outsides of every muscle , every branch of any artery that leads from the aorta , obscure and common differential diagnoses .
even knew the differential diagnosis to classify the real tubular acidoses .
and all the time , i collected more and more .
and i was good , i closed with course .
and i left the medical study with the impression that i if i knew all of it and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to as possible as possible that i was immunity as possibl
and it worked for a time until i met woman printers .
i resigned a teacher hospital here in toronto as woman as woman , and i was brought into the emergency department of the hospital .
at that point , i was the cardiological service in cardiological services .
and it was my commission when the emergency personal advice was looking for studying the emergency patients .
and give feedback to my doctor .
i studied woman printers , and she was in ate .
and when i listened to her , she made sounds .
and when i stopped her breast with the stethoscope , i could hear a braking sound on both sides , which told me that she &apos;s going under congestive heart failure .
that &apos;s a state where the heart fails , instead of pumping the entire blood further , part of the blood continues in the lungs , and it fills this one , and that &apos;s why the shortctime came
and that wasn &apos;t a hard to make diagnosis .
i put them , and i did myself to the treatment .
i gave their aspiri . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
and i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water to pill water , so they &apos;re out of the liquid .
and over a time of one and a half to two hours , started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and there i did my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without my doctor .
i didn &apos;t take the hearing and did what i should have , which was a call for him to deal with him , so that he had an opportunity to make your own picture .
and he knew her , he would have been able to explain additional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the help doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed , and so capable of taking the responsibility that i was that way , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
and by sending them home , i went to me a little voice in me that tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was so much of self-security that i asked the nurse , which was caring about woman printers , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about this and said , &quot; clear , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it &apos;s been yesterday .
so i signed up the lessons papers and a disease and a distance , and they brought them home .
and i got back to work .
the rest of the day , the night i had this next feeling in my point .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day i put my things , losing the hospital , and went to the parking lot to go home with the car , when i did something else i didn &apos;t .
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the sister that had seen by woman printers , but another three words to me , and these three words fear the most emergency resources that i know .
other mediciners are afraid this , but the emergence medicine is very special , because we &apos;re just going to see the patients .
the three words is , remember ?
&quot; remember the patients you send home ? &quot;
questioned the nurse .
&quot; so , it &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tone .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
and about an hour after her got at home after sending them home , and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistants went back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a da
she breathed and was blue .
the emergency personal moved all strands .
they gave their blood printers .
they closed them to the breathing machine .
i was shocked and dropped into the internal .
and i was living through this driving rate , because she came to the intensive situation , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , realized that she was never going to walk again .
and she hadn &apos;t suffered a treatment brain damage .
their family collected .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they made up with that .
on the day , they read them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they &apos;re saying that the names of those who have never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this ourselves .
the next weeks , i did myself , and i learned for the first time even the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because 
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend price , even though that one &apos;s going to go on a distinction , and then the best friend is leading you , and you &apos;r
if you &apos;re doing recurrence and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of teaching shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you in the inner sick .
it &apos;s the one who says that not what you &apos;ve done , but you &apos;re bad yourself .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my observation , he was very love .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he launched the weights and sure that i wasn &apos;t supposed to .
but i asked me these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the doctor ? why did i send her home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i going into medicine ?
so slowly , it put it ourselves .
i started feeling better .
and then on a polluted day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i might have told me better .
and i was that i was that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again , a mistake was that the voice might go .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened .
two years later , i had service in a community hospital north of toronto , and i went to a 25-year-old man .
it was a lot of going on , and i &apos;ve been .
he always showed here .
i looked in the rights , and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and when he went out of the door , he showed on his rights .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my cheristry asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the crazy ? &quot;
it turned out that he turns out he &apos;s a strengtock infection .
he had a potential disease called epigottics .
you can google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the ridge , but it &apos;s the upper breakthrough , and causes the close of the response .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intraveus antibotia , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , felt liberating , and went back to the work until it happened again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve moved twice a blind preservation .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially when you consider that you work in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there weren &apos;t the lack of their treatment .
i thought he thought he would have kidney stones .
i didn &apos;t order the x-ray of the kidney . when that was without finished , my colleague in the bottom of the patient was coming up in the lower right sector and called the operators .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i was ordering fluids to refrect him and asked my colleagues as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he realized an interest in the right bottom sector , he called the operators .
in both cases , operated , and it was good .
both cases said to me , asked me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but totally nonsense .
some of my plople happened in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , shame and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can &apos;t find the quiet voice that tells me what didn &apos;t really happen , how can i share it wit
how can i teach you my mistakes so that you don &apos;t move the same ?
if i went to a room -- as now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when the last time you &apos;ve been heard of somebody &apos;s falling about failure about failure ?
oh , you go to a cocktail party and there you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i went to a space full of colleagues and asked their immediate support , and ask them to tell you what i just told you , i wouldn &apos;t reach the end of the second story before they really woul
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that an orthopedic in my hospital had somebody the wrong leg , you think i would have looked at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s an amazing mistake .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes and the ones who don &apos;t do , the ones that restrict with bad results and with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we make those who make mistakes make us from medicine that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my mind about 20 years of medical show consciousness and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical trial about medical mistakes and wrong treatments , so everything i &apos;m starting fo
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely impossible .
we &apos;re working in a system that happens every day in which one of these 10 medications are either a false or wrong , where hospital infections are always becoming more and more and more and mor
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of environmental mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine captures the number at 100,000 .
these are strong understatements , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system where the medical knowledge is doubled , every two to three years , we can &apos;t be able to .
sleeping is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake so that we can take a perfect disease for a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patient with breast pain , make it swealing and sustainable and give him an easy alcoholized breath , and suddenly the story is considered with contemporation .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not a car ; they don &apos;t always report their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are mistakes inevitable .
so when you take the system , as i was taught , and extracts all the fascinated health experts , it &apos;s at the end of any more left at the end .
and do you know the leaders about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake : &quot; i would say to everybody of rescue &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ,
and then their pupills expand , they &apos;re coming in front of your head , then look down and swallow , and start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistakes i factered . &quot;
what you need is an environment that it &apos;s able to do .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it begins with a doctor .
the defined doctor is a human because it accepts his humanity , accepting it , is not proud of making mistakes , but puts everything from them to learn anything from them so that it can be passed on
it shares your experience with others .
it supports when others are talking about their mistakes .
and she shows other their mistakes , not to make it , but in a loving , supportive species so that all of them benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people are filling the system with life , and if that , people are making mistakes from time to time .
so the system develops developing backups that make it easier to create mistakes that make people inevitable , and it &apos;s even rewarded , and that &apos;s particularly rewarding people like me t
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m regret that , but i &apos;m trying to learn for the best possibility to pass it on others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about changing norms .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know that he was here in 1832 .
you might think that he had finished , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fishes .
he described one of them as very , usual . &quot;
it was a broken .
until the &apos; 80s , he was fished in big style .
now he &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
this story we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we &apos;re still going on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the brochures are still describing them .
what happened here ?
the second story should be a different concept , the changing ball of the change .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in west africa in 1971 .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i can integrate .
and i got a bad sun , and was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get from there .
it was my first sunband .
as you can see , the lagoons of palms and from a few mangroves .
there was a battle of about 20 centimeters , black brothers , an understanding of the funntary .
the fisherments of these bungards were very common , and the fishermers lived well from them , and the fishermen lived over average .
when i went back there in 27 years later , the fish was scratched on half of his size .
growing up five centimeters .
they were genetically pressed .
it was still fish .
people still were happy .
and the fish had the lucky to be there .
so it didn &apos;t change anything , and yet , everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my commission in the introduction of the training fishery in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , europe has a lot of developmental projects .
fishing means that started 100,000 fishes , the industrial fishing of this pretty ugly ship is called mutaiaa .
i went down to that , and we made ancestors all over the southern southern chinese sea , and especially in javase .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
now i know it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our beginning were swimm , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the streams , the trucks , were coral reef fish .
essentially , the ocean came on deck and then thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is going very quickly .
within a year , you &apos;re going through an ancestry , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . from -- in this case -- a tough reason or soft corals , that &apos;s going to be more powerful .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , you threw them away , because they were dead .
once , we started a living .
it wasn &apos;t drowned .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat good .
in fact , this mountain will accumulate by trums every time they drive in areas where they &apos;ve never been fished .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our norms of the new level and call us not memory what was there .
if you generalize it , that &apos;s what happens .
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for people , they are , of course .
each generation looks at the images that they take them at the beginning of their conscious life , as standard , and it &apos;s going to get everything from it .
then the difference becomes as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give an order of change .
and at the end , they &apos;re just going to get the remaining remains .
that &apos;s exactly what our goal is now .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not like they were .
you could now think that the problem is people who certainly lived when they lived in predatory societies , and they were just a few generations that they were doing .
because obviously , an animal that gave it very often , first of all , before it dies .
so you &apos;re not losing any animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
over time , we &apos;re focusing on the great animals , and in the sea , these are the big fish .
they get rarer because we start them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left and we think that &apos;s the normal .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists are going to confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you prevent in a former form , they &apos;re not like they like to exist the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a captain &apos;s report can &apos;t be used , or from fishing scientists normally don &apos;t use them , because he &apos;s not scientifi
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t true the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous large role that can play a sea protected area .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically returning the past .
we put the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the norms have changed and very low .
so the people who see a marine protected area and benefit from the insight that it allows you to return their norms .
what about the people who don &apos;t do that because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
here , i think , the art and the movie maybe filling the gap , and as simulations .
this is the chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whices -- 500 years ago .
and the colors and the scenes , maybe you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except from the pocahoness story , why were they touched by the imagery ?
because it &apos;s something that was lost in some ways .
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give is coming out of cameron so that he turns &quot; avatari i &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist germany , you had to have a writing machine , they registered them in the government .
they also had to register a sheet of example from this writing machine .
and the reason is that the government could track back where a text came back .
they found an article with wrong thoughts , they could feel the creators of these thoughts .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how somebody could do something like this , and how much that would restrict the speech .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but when you &apos;re buying a new color base printer today in 2011 to the leading laser printers and express one side , this side has light yellow spots on each page in a pattern that makes the pag
that &apos;s what happens today .
and there &apos;s no one that doesn &apos;t seem to express .
and this was an example that our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing online problems today .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can share the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , here &apos;s mr. dimitricry golbuw from kiep in the ukrain .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attacks to earn a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of online millionaires , multi-millionaires that made their money through attacks .
this is laddimis tastin from taruus in forestand .
this is alfred genzalzze .
stephen watt .
born sundin sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tair al-dadour and so on and so forth .
these people have come online to wealth , but they acquired it illegal by using money from our banking , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or also keygogrer , who have collected our credi
american intelligence age two months ago , the swiss conton of mr. smen jan jan here , and on this conto , 1.4 million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain self is on free foot , which is unknown .
and i &apos;m likely to argue that it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of online crime as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to be worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second largest attacks that we can observe today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , or , or through their audiences .
and groups like anonymous stopped over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main attacks : criminals that do the money , doing hackivists like anonymous , who are resisting with it , but the last groups are nations , who lead the attacks .
there &apos;s what we do is like the diginotar .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
digitonary is a full-power certification out of the netherlands -- because it was .
in the last fall , it had to suggest insolence , because diginotar was hacked .
somebody &apos;s broken , and the system had been hacking .
and last week in a meeting with the dutch governmental governments , i asked one of the conditions of this group , whether he thought it was possible that because of the digitonar hack people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
well , how do people die in some of these hacks ?
digitonary is a certification position .
they sell certifications .
what do you do with certifications ?
well , a certification you need if you &apos;ve got a website with phts , with s--scryplicated services , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , giall or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly spreading in totalitarian states like iran , where dissident foreign offers can be
but can you do when you &apos;re in a foreign location .
certification departments hack and exhibit fake certificates .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of digiotator .
how does it behave with the arab spring and the things that happened for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the instructions in april 2011 were the main quarter of the egyptian secret police , and that &apos;s what they found a lot of things .
in these acts , an order called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this order , the notes in germany were in germany that the egyptian government had sold some programs that they -- in very large communications -- any communication of the egyptian citizens c
they sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company &apos;s company is right here .
so western governments are transforming totalitarian governments so that they can go to their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , so-called the state stroams , and that was a trojane that was used by german government to see their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be suspected in a criminal fall , then your phone will be attacked with quite security .
but today we &apos;re far beyond .
they throw their internet connection .
they use means like the state trojans to play their computers with a trojan , who allows them to monitor their own communications to listen to their online discussions to collect their passwords .
so if we continue to think about things like that , then the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t affect me because i &apos;m a brate citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , our governments like trust , there &apos;s every right that we &apos;re depending on forever .
and we trust , we &apos;re trusting blind one of the future governments , a government that we may have in about 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to engage in the next 50 years .
it may appear weird , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete bolls .
the first competitions were made in 1868 , and they created a simple idea : modules from cement with finished measures that fit together .
there &apos;s been very quickly the most used buildings in the world .
they put us to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
and essentially , the concrete building was the building block of our time .
almost hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was called the automatically combined stone .
and within a few years , lego , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for each person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego is essentially the concrete business , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , in the same year , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastic unity that was going to get us from a world of the static , changed building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex cycles , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i don &apos;t accept that the building of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebes are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re preferred , light , tone and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect together with magnets .
they can &apos;t put them wrong around it .
the stones are colorful .
green is expansion , blue is electricity , pink is commitment and orange is cable .
so everything they have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and they can build very quickly larger cycles .
they add a blue to one green , and you can do light .
you can put a switch in between , and so they created a little dumber .
take the switch out around a pulse module that &apos;s here , and they made a little blinder .
add this buzzer for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a noise .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , littlebbits actually is pretty powerful .
instead of programming , you &apos;ve got to program or solves , little libers allows you to program them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to speed or slow down or slow down , just turn in this button , and he &apos;s doing the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind little left is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction around the world into a finished rock .
lights , solar elements , solar emements , everything should be available .
we &apos;ve distributed littlese to children and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start understanding the electronics that you start to understand and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a night light works , or why the doors of the elevator respond , or respond like an ipod on touch .
we &apos;ve also brought littless to design schools .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with litebiles as a material .
here we see , with film , paper and water bottles , like geordi ..
a couple of weeks ago , we brought litelites to risd , and they gave some designers that had no technical experience -- just carbon , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; does what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a movemental conferent cannon .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer from the key , which has fear in the darkness .
for these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so litelites is open source .
they can go to the website , download all the design presentations and make them ourselves .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor that encourages contributors , because the world in which we live in , this interactive world , is belong .
so , pull it up and start inventing .
thank you .
