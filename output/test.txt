you know , one of the great resources travel , and one of the great research is at ethnographic research , together with people who can remember the old days , and their past still feels them on the
just knowing that jaguar shamans are still traveling beyond the milky way or the meaning of the myths of the elders of inuit are full of importance , or that in himalayas , the buddhist still exists
and of course , we all share the same adaptation needs .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we &apos;re going through initiation rituals .
we need to deal with the inconvenient separation through death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dancing and produce art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique face of song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the pena in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolythis in haiti , or the warriors in the middle of the sahara , the curanane in the middle of the 
all these people teach us that there are other existences , other thinking , other ways to orientation on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only feel with hope .
together , the number of cultures in the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life , which the earth is as important and for the problem of the earth , like the biological lifestyle , whic
you can imagine this cultural life as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be produced as the total of all the thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspirations and intuitions that have been produced
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of what we are , and what we &apos;re as astonishingly desperate species .
and just like the biosphere happened , this happened with the ethnosphere -- just with even larger speed .
not a biologist , for example , suggesting that 50 percent or more of all species are just before dying , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarion on the field 
and the critical indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
when each of them were born in this room , they talked about 2,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the entire of the vocabulary or a series of grammatic rules .
one language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture finds access to the material world .
each language is like an old-field of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , exactly half of them don &apos;t walk into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught anymore . that means when nothing is going to be done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely to be one of the last ones to be one of the last of your people who speak your language , no way to give the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope of children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually somebody elsewhere on earth , every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly and takes an elderly and takes the last silve of an old language with
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place when we just talk a language ? &quot
let &apos;s be cogo . &quot;
and then suddenly you &apos;d see what it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
that &apos;s why i want to take you today in a trip through the ethnosphere , a short trip through the ethnosphere to try to understand what was actually lost .
now there &apos;s some of us who forget that if i say &quot; different possibilities , &quot; really different possibilities of mine .
for example , take this child of the baranana in the northwest of the amazona , the people of anaconda , believe that they came out of mythologically from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t cognitively differ between the colors of blue and green , because the heaven level of the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language and a marriage process that &apos;s called linguistic exogamy : you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking about a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past . the strange thing about these great houses , where six or seven languages will be talked about is that you never hear somebody who learns a language 
you just listen to and then you start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the warona in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that was first contacted in 1985 peacefully .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to record and made a severely mistake .
they were throwing shiny photos from the air what we would grade for friendly gestures , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen something two dimensional
they have these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the figure , didn &apos;t found anything , and conclusioned that these are the five missionaries with the spear .
but the watarani not only killing outside with the spear .
they were tracking each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by threats .
we followed the generalioy of eight generations , and two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people with pressure something about it , they gave them that one of the people had become so o
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps and determine which animal kind of animals .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor harvard wondered whether i would be interested in going to haiti and infiltrate the secret societies that were used to make su
to give a sense to give a sense , of course , something about these remarkable beliefs in the voodo , and voodo is not a culture of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the big world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism or whatever .
one continent is always leaved , because the suggestion was that there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was an and voodo is just the result of these very deep religi
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and deaths .
the living birds are the spirits .
the minds can be contributed from under the great water , answers to the rhythm of dance to get the soul of the living transition , so that the acolyth is going to become the god .
so the voodooesis like to say , &quot; your white goes into the church and talks about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken from the mind . how can you damage ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolythies in a trance constitution that recognizes the glowing coal without combination , an amazing impact on the ability of the mind that if he &apos
well , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the cogi from the sierra nevada da santa marta in north columbia , the most extraordinary things .
after the old tyrannian civilization , which is populating the caribbean coast levels of columbia , and in consequences of the education moved into an isolated volcanic massive that goes up over the
in a blood flucked continent , these people were the only ones that have never been conquered by the spaning .
until today , it &apos;s governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education to the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are separated at the age of three and four years of their families , and in a shadow place world of the glacier , where they spent the nine years of pregnancy that they spent in t
and during this whole time , it &apos;s culturally introduced into the values of their society , values that their prayers are prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecol
at the end of this amazing initiation , one day you &apos;ll suddenly take outside in your life , at the age of 18 , you &apos;ll see a sun , and in this crystal consciousness of the first light , w
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
and whenever we think of integrations and landscape , we &apos;re either going to complain rouseau and the old quiet of the noble wild , which is a racistic thought or on the other hand , these peop
so , inbornes are not sentimental , they &apos;re going to be weaken from nostalgia .
there &apos;s not a lot of place in the malarial traditions of tibet , or the cold winds of tibet , but they &apos;ve still being shaped by time and ritual , the idea that the earth can only exist b
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andies that grows up in the belief that the mountain is an apuine , who &apos;s going to determine your destiny , a very different human , and have a different 
whether it &apos;s a spirit of a mind , or a bunch of earth , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to be true .
and that made me to another person as my friends , who believe that these forests are living out of the hucke and the committed skin , and the cannibal spirits that live in the north of the world , 
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i just recorded last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahusaa , that many of you have heard , the most powerful psychoactive preparation from the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
what ayahusaa makes so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preparation , but what it &apos;s processing . on the one hand , there &apos;s two different sources , on the one
this plant contains some very powerful tryptomines that are very similar to the serotonin , dimethylytryping methoyylyptem that &apos;s very similar to the serotonin .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanoma , as you saw this stuff , this substance , which is made from different species as well as methohydimymethylycity .
sneaking this powder is something like being shot out of a gransformation , of baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even had my professor , richard evan schultes , the man who put the psychedelic area with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 3000s , discussing that , and i said that you couldn
but the thing about tryptomines is that they can &apos;t be taken oral , because they &apos;re going to be in the human name , of course , named monamin oxides .
they can only be taken in connection with some other chemicals that the mao denature .
now the fascinating is that the betabarrobiles that are in the lian , mao minitors of exactly the way that &apos;s necessary to potentiate the tryptamines . so ask themselves .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of addresting plants find these two morphologically related plants that , if that combines this way , create a kind of biochemical version so that
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistakes , which turns out to be meaningless .
but ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 variations of ayahusaa that you &apos;re all going to recognize the great distance in the forest that appear to our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them how they get their taxonomics , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand some of the plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you &apos;re taking each of the 17 variations at full of them , and they sing them to one in a different deal .
well , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than stamina .
well , the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult position to the difficult positions that they &apos;re as organill and color , but it &apos;s kind of limited to the p
so , the fact is that in 300 years , you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were about , and the massive destruction of biologi
all the cultures have always involved in the dance with new lifes .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sioux indians didn &apos;t hear less to sioux when they took bows and arrows than the americans stopped being americans when they tasked horse and horse .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the ethnosphere . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the learning .
and wherever you look around in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures aren &apos;t written to the disease . these are dynamically living peoples whose existence seems to fill in the 
or when we go to the mountains of tibet , where i recently , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people is generally convicted , but the ethnosics , the destruction of the lives of people , not only will not be convicted , but generally , and
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering tibets if they didn &apos;t experience it on the bottom level .
and i traveled with a young colleague , 6,000 miles from chengru in westerna overland from southeast tibet to leasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of which yo
the father of this young man was identified as the people &apos;s lama .
that meant that he &apos;s been taken during the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle flew their holiness into the diaspora that brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up as punishment -- for criminal to be wealthy .
he was smuggled into prison at the age of two years to hide underneath her rock bag , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister that was actually going this bittle bit , was brought into an education camp .
one day , she stood out of the arms of mazos , and for this overlap , she had to go into a heavy work camp for seven years .
the suffering can be unbearable , but the suffering spirit of people is something that &apos;s informed .
and at the end , we &apos;re really going to be a choice . what do we want to live in a monotory world of monoto , or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that while we &apos;re moving towards a flath , designed , generic world , we &apos;d not only see the entire range of human imagination
and it &apos;s humbling about thinking about maybe our species exists for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and we &apos;ve been doing this moment to the cult of the satcon , the poetry of the shaman through the prost of priesthood and hierarchy , spe
the modern industrial world as we know it is about 300 years old .
well , this superficial story tells me that we all have the answers to the challenges that we &apos;re standing towards the coming millennia .
if we ask these countless world cultures after the meaning of human , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song we &apos;re going to rediscover the opportunity to be what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of that all humans and gardens have to travel a space , and there a
here &apos;s a picture that i took at the northern end of the baffin islands when i went to the narwhahal fills , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the 1000s , at the train of our regime , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family that was afraid of his life , took all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the flights of their sweets were originally from fish that was developed in karibus skin .
the grandfather of the man didn &apos;t afraid before the arctic night or the grandfather .
and he went outside , he had his pans out of sea , and defected in his hand , and when the feces started , he formed them into the form of a knife .
he started speaking on the sides of the feces knife , and when it was completely frozen , he approached a dog .
and he encouraged the dog , and improvising a distance , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvising a sledge , excused a different dog , and disappeared across the ice cultures with the feceal k
that &apos;s what you can do from nothing .
and this is a symbol for the resistance of the inui and all of the individuals in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit , in april 1999 , the complete control over an area , which is larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nowature .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all minerals .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can be looking for and achieve its people .
and ultimately , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to these distant goals of the earth to recognize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the home countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that goes back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are part of the hope .
what we &apos;re trying at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics can &apos;t be convincing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytel
165 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of travels into the ethnosphere , where we take our audiences to places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re blinded by the second , and hopefully , you &apos;l
thank you .
what i &apos;m first first , as fast as possible , show is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of an over a year ago . this is a seadragon , and it &apos;s an envi
we &apos;re looking at many , many gigabets of the digital photos that you &apos;re understanding and continuously to get into any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one is , for example , a scan of congress library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixes .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the power of a system can restrict is the number of pixels on their screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , an example of non-sign data .
this is bleek house of dickens . every color is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text and not about a picture , we can really show you that this is a real representation of the text and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the pleasure , and the good experience to read a real paper experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular expect of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we &apos;ve added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really reaches these ideas to create these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that that means not a pop-up and other meaning -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all streets in the u.s. .
over on the top of nasa &apos;s pictures .
let &apos;s get something else .
this is now even live on the internet . you can tell it .
this is a project called photosynth , which really connects two different technologies .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research about computer vision , a university of washington , an university of the university of washington , underneath the steve seat in the u.k.
and rick scelliscs was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through pictures and make this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial order of the images here is actually meaning .
the computer vision algorithms have started to have these images together so that they were made the real space , where these recordings that all made near the grassia or panoramic imagery , and the
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth where we first worked in the summer to show them what i think is really the point
we had to worry about the lawyers and so worry .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notrel dame who was establishing in the computer with pictures of flickr . give you nother lade in flickr , and they &apos;re going to represent images of m
so these are all flickr pictures , and they &apos;re all standing at this way in relationships .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i was going to work on microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that these are many different kinds of cameras : everything is , from cell phone camera to professional slrss , a very large number of them who have been collapsed in this en
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange .
many of them are covered by faces , and so on .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of notred dame , which was really recorded .
we can change the poster into a physical view of this environment .
and the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s going to collect data from all -- from the entire collective storage of how visual the earth looks -- and everythi
all these photographs are connected , and it creates something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
look at this as the continuence of stephen wallers of virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that people use it , which people are using it , growing and their users to use with the user with the application .
their own photographs are described with metadatas , which has entered another person .
when someone has done and described all these sacreds and determines all these sacreds and demonstrates who they are all , my photograph from the notre dame cathedral suddenly becomes all this data 
and of course , side products all of these are the immensive virtual models of each of the earth that have been not only by surviving or satellite images and so forth , but through collective memory
thank you .
do i understand them right ? i do i understand them right ? her software enables that at a certain point , within the next few years , all images that are used by somebody in the world , basically ,
yeah . it doesn &apos;t matter than discoveries .
if they want them to create hyperlinks between the images .
and she &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the full of the semantic information that many of these images have .
what if you do a weapon for pictures , where they put sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what picture is .
but what if the image you linked with all their pictures ?
and then the scale of the semantic connection and the full that gives out of it , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . heally happiness .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some of the things from my book that i hope in the understanding of the other things you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if they di
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official faith of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this , if our goal is maximizing the community of our citizens , this is actually going through maximizing the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , an invisible condition for the human .
when people have freedom , each of us are actually about to do the things that maximize and nobody has to decide for us .
maximizing freedom to maximize choice .
the more choices have people , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom you have , the more freedom you have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that there wouldn &apos;t be any in the mind to question it .
and it &apos;s also rooted deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . not a big one .
i just want to say something about salatressing .
there are 175 dessings in my supermarket , when you couldn &apos;t count the 10 different olive oilens , and 12 of the great number of olive oiles that you could buy to make a large number of your o
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
and then you go back to the consumer electronic business to put together a stereo statement -- speakers , cd players , a cassette player , radio , more powerful , and in this one electronics , there
we can make 6.5 million different stereos from the components that are offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communications .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every telephone that you wanted to have , as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t bought it .
a consequence of what was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the mobile phone .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- mp3 player , nasa hair trimes and crime brulle facel .
and shouldn &apos;t you see this yet in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to run into the business and ask that question .
you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are much more important than the buy of objects , the same explosion of choices are .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells them : we could make , or we could make it .
has these benefits and risks .
has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , is these benefits and risks , and it has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift of the responsibility for the meetings of someone who knows , and there
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , that , if you think about it , at all doesn &apos;t make sense because we don &apos;t buy them .
why are they asking around us , if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is : you expect to call the doctor on the next morning and ask a change in prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choices , like showing this slide .
we don &apos;t have an identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re inventing as often as we want .
that means that every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost every one had and they got them so quickly as they could , and then get kids so fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
today , everything is easy .
i teach them wonderful intelligent students , and i give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i now ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or should i make careers ? &quot;
they &apos;re all incredible questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions independently whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you two and not good need in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important answering questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , like carl &apos;s allowed to work with the technology that enables us to work on the planet every minute of every place on the planet -- to the randol h hotel .
there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody where the wirlesslan works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work to make decisions again and again and again , whether we should be working or not to work .
we can play our children in the football , and we have our cell phone on the one hip , and our blackberry on other hips , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned on , every minute where we &apos;re going to ask our children in a football game , we should be wondering , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s sure your experience of the football game is very different than it had been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we look like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good at this , so i &apos;m going to know what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxically , is that he &apos;s paralyzing .
with so many options that you can choose , it &apos;s very difficult to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of that , a study about investments in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investment acts of vanguard , the giant fond society of about a million collaborators and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was per 10 investment that the employer was offered , the participation was at two percent .
they offer 50 investment funds -- 10 percent less collaborators take part of if it was going to offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment foods that are standing to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you &apos;re supposed to choose to choose in tomorrow .
and then morning , and then morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes in .
understand that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go into the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to return , it also means the decision makes so har
through the not participation , they give up to 5,000 a year on from the employer who would have been happy to reproduce your contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world looks like this .
you really want the decision to really meet when it &apos;s for everybody , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong saladressing .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome paralysis and meet a decision , we end up with the result of the choice than if we had the opportunity to decide we ha
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is conducted by the great selection of different salad ressings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , what salad tressing is already perfected : and what happens is that
the more opportunities there are , the more opportunity is nothing to regret , that &apos;s disappointing for the choice that you meet .
secondly , what economists call operating costs .
dan gilbert did this morning by telling how much the way we rate things , from depending on what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives , it &apos;s just to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that you &apos;re exclusive , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives the
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here is what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my manhated neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the opportunity to have day over day , a great parking lot .
oper-tunity costs drive the happiness that we get through our selection , even though what we &apos;ve done is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are the choices , the more attractive properties of that choice is considered in the operating cost .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon does some statements .
he &apos;s doing a statement about living and maybe to do things slowly .
but an important point he &apos;s doing is , whenever you decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less attractive .
third , escalation of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was one time where there were jeans of a way , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they were washing long enough , they started feeling &
so , to buy new yeans , after many years of the old days , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want to be blank , slightly longing or far ?
do you want to have buttons or graduates ? stone or ocean acid ?
do you want to have jeans with holes ?
they want to cut down at the bottom , bland blah , blah ... &quot; and so he told her .
my jaw was down and after recovering myself , &quot; i would like to have the way that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour to try and try all these damn jeans , and very the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best fitting jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all this choice allowed me to have me better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain myself .
the reason i felt worse , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what &apos;s going on for a good pair of jeans .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have concrete expectations than they were in a species .
when they came in 100 species , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was expecting , and what i had was disappointing in comparison to what i expected .
and that increases possibilities in the lives of people increasingly increasingly expectations have increasingly increased about how well these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because , if they were , you wouldn &apos;t know what they &apos;re going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason which was all better than anything worse than anything was worse than anything was worse for people that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best you can hope is that things are as good as you expect it .
they &apos;ll never surprise because their expectations , my expectations , are home .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve come for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have made it better . i didn &apos;t leave me .
but leaving is not always a bad thing .
eventually , a consequence of buying jeans if there &apos;s only one way of buying jeans if they &apos;re unhappy , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is responsible . the world is
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the disappointing , and they wonder why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is .
you could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the woodest , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even though the results of the choices are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only but a significant contributors to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointing because their standards ar
and so the result is that we &apos;re generally better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remember them .
this is the official dogma that we all keep for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that something &apos;s better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow , the more choice is better than something .
there &apos;s a magic lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point on the selection of improving our common good .
now , as an essential question -- i &apos;m almost -- i &apos;m almost done -- as an essential question , the thing about thinking about is , which enables all this choice in the industrialized soci
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you , their problem is not the great choice .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a pretty problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and profound : steve levit has tell you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to help them installing car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy they don &apos;t help .
they actually do .
you &apos;re worrying for what we &apos;re going to stand .
if something that people &apos;s people &apos;s people are allowing to make decisions in which people would have too little choices , not just improves lives of people , but our would be improved .
economists call this a pare-improvement .
income distribution is going to worry about all the better -- not just the poor , because all of this great choice is going to do .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a very highly developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold fish glass . &quot;
fuzzy phantage , a short-term view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came up with the view that the fish is something .
because the truth is , if you break the gold fish glass so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the gold fish glass , so that everything is possible , get the happiness .
they increase the paralysis and drive happiness .
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
this is almost complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but this is a metaphoric gold fish glass is a recipe for elevation , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we started by a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and build new lifes .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and that in different levels .
we have different approaches to simplify it until the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years , and when we sequenced the humanogenome , the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate , or whether we can create new lifes , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma getaium , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate himself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with an even smaller gen
we &apos;ve been able to display it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something like this .
but when we look at this metabolic map that &apos;s very simple , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it
and so we decided that the only way to the front is to actually synthesizing this chromosome that allows us to have the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does the chemistry make these really large molecules what has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is , by the way , a piece of interest chemical material .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been very slowly developed , but our final point is going to get into an exponential curve .
we started for 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years with a biothetic review before we did the first experiments .
and as it turns out , dna synthesization is very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could sit together these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , beginning with the digital information , the genome phi /771 .
it &apos;s a little virus of the bacteria .
we created little pieces , we made a mistake correction , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting phase came up when we took this piece of chemicals and gave it into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were released from the cells , and came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they understood this model .
they laughed more than you do .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually building your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much more . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 850,000 letters genetic codes . so we thought we could build it in cassettes from the size of
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really failure .
when we sequenced the genome in 1995 in 1995 , the mistakes were per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes . if we had used the original sequence , they never would have been possible .
one part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to leave them with other 50 letters , to build smaller sub-suitations together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built satings .
think about it : we have a four-letter code , a , c , c , g .
triplets of these letters -- these letters code about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single determination for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
beginning , we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve simply constructed them that we could just drag them with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair them and put together again .
and we started creating pieces , beginning with pieces that had five to seven thousands of letters , these approached them together to make 24,000 letters to make them together , up to 72,000 .
in each step , we produced these pieces of surplus so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of creating what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of the automation .
so , this looks like a basketball playfof .
if we went to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s overwhelming all possibilities of modern molecular biology , and
we knew about a mechanism of the homologist recombination that biology can use to repair dna that can put together like that .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s one organism called denococcus radioduranure of the three million wheels of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been put together like this .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dried , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life is existing in space and move around in searching for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a competition from the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve been using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces that we &apos;ve
this is not an electron microscope it &apos;s a regular microscope .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are recordings over six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve just been doing recently .
that &apos;s over 850,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the biggest molecule with defined structure ever created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we expressed it with a writing size of 10 and without a distance , it would be about 144 pages , just to express this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how are we going to activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in exactons as we are : you just take the nucleus out and give another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the cloning .
in archabecteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but just recently , we showed that you can do a complete transplant of a cell to the other , and activate them .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbes species . rough said , these two are from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing than 
the new chromosome went to the cell .
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species that have taken a second chromosome or a third of somewhere , every time thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to change at a time that &apos;s been missed a lot from biology .
there are enzymes that are called the restriction enzymes that actually digest the dna .
the chromosome that we had in the cell was nothing ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve introduced .
it was expressed in the cell and realized the other chromosome as a stranger material , and that &apos;s how we had only one cell with a new chromosome .
it sold blue because of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we transported .
it may sound like genomic alchmimies , but we can , by shifting the software dna , things are pretty dramatic .
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not the genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years evolution .
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which massive new education could be based on this digital design .
why would we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re about six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has existed in 1964 , within 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge to offer for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions of betters oil . these are hundreds of million betters a day .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace this , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material that lands in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronic industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity of that .
we &apos;re in first line on the limits of biological reality and that of our idea .
we have technologies because of these fast synthesis , to do what we call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or optimize these processes to optimize octans or drugs , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just normal selection . we can select for lifestyle , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a recording of real design software that we &apos;re actually working with , which you actually sit and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like . we know exactly like their genetic code .
so we &apos;re focusing on fuel of fourth generation .
they recently saw maize to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels of the second and third generation that &apos;s relatively coming out that are going to have much higher successives , like octan or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to have a great influence without another increase in the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , and so we &apos;re working on 
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first ones with fuels of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discoveries of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1966 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one-and-a-half miles deep , nearly cooking water temperatures .
it transforms in methane under the use of hydrogen as an energy source .
we &apos;re studying whether we can use co2 that could be just to production , convert the co2 in the fuel to power this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- moderate goals like the replacement of the entire petrochemical industry , exactly . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise ? a main source of the energy
but that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re working on is to use the same approaches for the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this with the flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and you have a dollar too little when it comes around the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building recombinant vaccines in the previous .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes , today can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and potentially eucaryonts .
we &apos;re removed light years from improving people , and our goal is just that we have a chance to survive for long enough to do that . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to get back to explain how the machine works .
now , it &apos;s like that . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever been -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
his problem is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of the seconds at the beginning of the universe -- and that up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathing ambitious .
this is the machine underneath genes .
we take images of these mini-big bangs in detectors .
that &apos;s what i work . it &apos;s called atlas &apos;s detector -- 40 feet in the diameter , 22 meters in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction to see the size of the size .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine was going on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused immense jewels in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radian particle that was the entire track around the lhc , and then intentionally , with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the greatest jewel , or this , when somebody was visiting the google side and the face so found .
it means we reached a cultural influence next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had done with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires spend 13 thousands of amples when the machine goes on high performance .
now , the engineers among them are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that , because if you cool very far , they will come to so-called superconductors .
by minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can be tension .
in one of the connections , between over nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manufacturing defect .
and by heating the wires little bit , and 13 thousands of americans , suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
well , that &apos;s all more impressive if you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and shiften around about 80 percent .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we were doing .
we conditioned them new , repairing them .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
by the end of march , the lhc is going to be back to functional .
we &apos;ll turn it up , and we expect the first data in june or july , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
well , of course , in some ways , the debate that are starting to reject the value of science and engineering to those borders . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we &apos;re going out about our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words of an english scientist , humphrey davy , who i suspect when he was defending the useless experiments of his teaching , his teaching was finished , that our t
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever .
however , recently happened in my life and my career that made me rethink my relationship to this work .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called a-eat , prayy , love -- that decided that all my previous books went to the world and got a big mega-event , international b
the result is , no matter where i &apos;m going , treatments like i &apos;m going to be treated .
seriously -- that &apos;s going on .
for example , they &apos;re concerned about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to operate this success ?
do you have no fear that you would write your entire life and never create a book that anybody in the world is interested in ? never ?
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remind myself , about 20 years ago , when i first told me as a teenager , that i wanted to be writer with the same kind of anxiest response .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you fear to have success ?
don &apos;t you have any fear that the humility of stuff ?
don &apos;t you have fear that you &apos;re going to get your life long , and that you &apos;re never going to die something , and that you &apos;re going to die on a scratch of deseases -- your mou
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and that &apos;s what i always had .
and i have a lot more things that nobody was going to do .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
but when it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it and ask me , why ?
is this reasonable ?
is it logical that somebody should expect to do the work that he feels professionally ?
and what &apos;s exactly with the creative enterprises that they make us uncertain about the mutual state -- in a way that they don &apos;t do other professions ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years as a chemist where he was asked to be afraid of being chemists .
with your chemist blockage , john , how are you going to do with this ?
it just didn &apos;t came , you know ?
but being fair -- the group of the chemists haven &apos;t getting the centuries of alcohol considered manic depressed people .
and we are writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creatives of all genes , seem to have this reputation to have mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitters deaths from really great heads alone from the 20th century that died young and often of your hand .
and even the people who didn &apos;t actually come to suici they were really neglected by their talents .
norman mailer said just before his death in his last interview : every one of my books had killed me a little bit forward . so each of my books killed me a little bit . &quot;
an extraordinary statement that you can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even hear somebody something like this , because we &apos;ve been knowing these kinds of statements for so long ago , somehow we accepted the idea of so internalized and collectiv
the question i &apos;d like to ask everybody here today is : is this idea for you totally right ?
do you feel like that ? because with only one centimeter , i don &apos;t feel like this , and i feel with this notion at all .
i think they &apos;re delivered .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it &apos;s going to take over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative environments .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , it would be starting to start this dark path of guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 work in me .
and it &apos;s extremely probably that everything i &apos;m going to write about the world as the world that came after the driving success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it right now , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here -- it &apos;s probably that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought ?
these are the kinds of thoughts that somebody can bring somebody to start drinking a gine in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would continue to do that work that i love .
so the question is , how ?
after a couple of time of reflectivity , i seem to continue to write to write a kind of protective psychological construct .
somehow , i &apos;ve got to find a way in writing to write a safe distance between me and my very natural education about how the reaction is going to be on the writing .
while i was looking for models for models to do this , i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , and i tried to find other societies to see if they can help creativity with the emotional risks that
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close back .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity of people come from , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of diviner spirit that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- for unknown , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine sentences of creativity of demons .
from socrates , known that he believed he had a demon who showed him from further .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of likely creative spirit , genius ...
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic divine creature that it &apos;s literally living in the walls of an artist material -- just like dobby , the houseless -- the outcome and the artis
this is brilliant -- there is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that i &apos;ve been talking about from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected by certain things like , like , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this body genius that helped you .
when your work , when your work is -- not all your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew that your genius was something .
so people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and that big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all of gods and myster
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people hear this or those artists call a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i &apos;ve got to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know , i think that i think , i think , allow the person to allow you to think he or she was like the design and the essence , and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite myster
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
that &apos;s designed and distorted whole egos , and it creates all of these innovitable expectations to success .
and i think that this success pressure has connected our artists over the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change ?
perhaps to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t take rational humanism for 500 years of rational humanism in an 18-minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that would really quick scientific scientific doubts about the idea of -- basically -- feels that apply people and apply their projects .
i &apos;m not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes the same sense like everything i &apos;ve heard when it went to explain the absolute crazy to explain creative process .
one process that -- like everybody knows that has tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , he can sometimes feel paranomically .
i recently had an encounter when i met the extraordinary american poeter ruth stone , who was over 90 , who was over 90 , but she told me that she was growing up on the fields in the virginia outsid
she said it would be like a tundering train from air .
that &apos;s what the country was going to go on to them .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew she could only do one such a moment in this moment , and that was -- in their words -- races like the devil .
she ran up like the devil to the house while she was followed by this poem , and it was only about that she had to get enough to a piece of paper and a pen , so that if it could come through through
in other paints , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house and the poem said it wouldn &apos;t draw across the country and missed
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments that they missed it almost .
so , she runs the house and looks after the paper and the poem drives through it , and she &apos;s going through a pen that &apos;s going through you and then , she said -- it was like going to the 
and she got the poem in his tail , and she pulled it back in her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came into the poem and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the first word for the first .
when i heard this , i thought that &apos;s incredible -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on . it &apos;s exactly how my creative process .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a mast animal . i have to work every day at the same time and sweat , and sweat , and really dropping through .
but even in my masternian , sometimes this thing stripped .
and i guess that many of you have done that as well .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we relate to the relationship without losing our minds , but keep us on the opposite even in mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to create this , the musician tom waits can interview it a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was the embodiment of the modern artist , who was trying to dominate these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him and co
but then he became older and frighter . he told me that he was driving one day on a fast road in los angeles . and then everything changed for him .
he was driving with high speed when he suddenly heard a little fragment of a melody that &apos;s often difficult for him , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s powerful . he &apos;s listening , but 
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a cassette recorder .
so he starts to rise this old falling inside him , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to lose from this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not creating it . i &apos;m not .
but instead of going into panic , he just stopped up .
he ended up the whole thought , and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , sorry , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
so look like i can just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheaper moment when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else today .
go and source leonard cohen .
his whole work process has changed after that .
not the work themselves . it was continued to continue to dark like him and ever .
but the process and the heavy delivery that surrounds him , was up when he took the genius out of where he caused nothing as an anger and left him back where he came down . he realized that it had n
it could give an obvious , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange , extraordinary thing , which was not all tom .
when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it &apos;s been saving me .
and this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of eat , pray , love , and i fell in one of these groups of the doubt in which we all do , if we work something and doesn &apos
not just bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just stop the project .
but then i remembered how tom had talked in the free heavens and i tried .
so i was going to look from the manuscript , and i was talking to my comment towards an empty corner of the space .
i talked about -- listen , you thing , you , and i know both if that book is not brilliant that it &apos;s not completely my blame , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m seeing everything i have , i &apos;m investing . i don &apos;t have anymore than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to shoot here and contain your fraction of the development .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then you get to the devil .
i &apos;m going to wort of write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i &apos;d like to please to protocol that i was here today for my part of the job .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . eventually , in the deserts of north africa &apos;s deserts have been holding up to the moons of holy dancing and music gathering for hours -- to
these are always great , because the dancers were professionally , and they were fantastic .
but back and over again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the performers were actually transmitted .
and i know you know what i mean because i know that you &apos;ve all seen such a performance in your life .
it was like silence and standing through some kinds of ports , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he did ever before -- 1,000 nights before , but all of them were asking together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to human human .
it &apos;s been recovered by the inside , and it &apos;s brought up and everything got through a divine fire .
as something happened at that time , people knew what that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing : allah , allah , allah , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical footpone : when the more south spain came up with this . the outlands changed this stuff over the centuries of allah , allah , ol , ol ole , which you &apos;re still listening
when a contributor in spain has something done something that &apos;s a little magical : ellah , ole , ol , ol , ole , great , bravo &apos;s unacceptable , there &apos;s a fluid look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer itself wakes up , and realizes that it &apos;s 14 outs on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a fine of god .
it &apos;s just an aging mortality with painful knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to these altitudes .
and perhaps never become god &apos;s name calls when he turns , but what do we start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be quite as much people if they didn &apos;t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of their own of them came from them .
if you &apos;re just believed that you &apos;re a leader -- from an imaginable source for an imaginable source for an older period of your life that &apos;s passed on somebody else , if you &apos;re
and when we start thinking about it , that &apos;s changing everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think , with security in the past months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to be appearing -- when the dangerous , frightening , strongly expected
what i have to say to myself is , if i &apos;m crazy , i don &apos;t have any fear .
didn &apos;t disagree .
just do your job .
it &apos;s continuing for your contributions , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dancing .
if the dumb divine genius that you &apos;re put on the side , decides to show you a short moment through your effort , and then ollep !
and if not , dance yet your dance .
and ool ! for you , despite all you .
i believe it , and i feel like we should teach .
you &apos;ve got the human love and the meaning that you have the human love and the meaning to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
ol !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice camp , which for about three million years , the size of the lower 48 states had been scratched by 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t press the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not showing the thinks of the ice .
in some sense , the arctic ice camp is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it &apos;s growing in the winter and screen in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a time-leak recording of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
that &apos;s the red time .
as you can see , it marked on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in the winter , and it &apos;s dropping in the summer .
so what &apos;s called , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which leaves out of the body .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming does the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s great amounts of frozen carbon which , when he &apos;s going to be implemented by microbe
compared to the entire contribution of climate changing in the atmosphere , it could double if we translate this critical point .
already today , in some flat seas in alaska methane of even from the water .
professor kate &apos;s university of the university of alaska is traveling with another flat that was last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how we &apos;re going to do .
and one reason is that there &apos;s this enormous home story , greenland is getting greenland from the north .
this is an annual death water .
but the volumes are essentially larger than ever before .
this is the greenlass stream in southwest greenland .
if you want to know what the sea level rises through country melting here , it flows into the sea .
these rivers are taking rapidles .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice ice on the planet .
last month researchers struggled that the entire continent now has a negative ice .
and the west antarctica that &apos;s stopped across a couple of underwater islands is particularly strong in melting .
this is 20 feet levels , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice , you see up the top of new seas that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world are getting half their drinking water from this melting water .
in the end , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the waters have blown up .
but when they feel , the most drinking water is going to fall .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the snows of the sierra was seen .
this is the memory bags .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read they &apos;re serious .
this extraction around the world leads to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the disasters all over the world have in a really extraordinary and previous before that they were never going to do .
four times as many over the last 30 years , like in the previous 75 .
this is a completely unstandard development pattern .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 -- 25 million tons of co2 -- 25 million tons every day into the oceans every day .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , from the american continent of western and both of the indian sub-continents , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next deforestation , which is 20 percent , the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states are one of the biggest pollutions , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot of other carbon factories .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a change .
here are the ones that have been struggled in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been suggested .
yet there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the coal industries and oil industries have spent a quarter billion dollars last calendar to apply clean coal , which is a contradiction .
this picture reminded me of something .
christmas walking around in my home in tennessee , a billion tons of carbon .
you &apos;ve probably seen it in the news .
this is in our whole country of the second largest waste flow at america .
this happened christmas .
one of the advertisements of the carbon industry around christmas was this .
frosty of carbon is a foughter , quick guy .
he &apos;s going to be in shell and fills in america , and he &apos;s going to help our economy .
frosty , the carbon man gets cleaners every day .
it &apos;s affordable and lovely , and workers stay in lone and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful constructor is the ladder of massey coal .
let me just say that . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change has called into life .
this is one , part of her .
in coalrgy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve been to the top of the moment to spend a significant sense of money to bring an advertising on the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s still smelling good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that to us .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s do a tour of that modern , clean carbon factory .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , burning coal of one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is the clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red death that connects them all , our dependence on carbon-based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to free us out of that mission .
services america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years within the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work , make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
services america new . find out more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a new service of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels that stop our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good jobs .
services america new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , alone .
if you want to come together , get together . &quot;
we need to come far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to think about the time of your childhood when they were playing with building locks .
while they realized how to extract the hands and access the skots and moves , they learned to think about understanding and problems through understanding and changing spatial contexts .
the spatial thinking is enough to connect how we understand a lot of our environments .
as an information -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my colleague , patti and my colleague , jeevan kalanthi , i started wondering : what if we could use compu
and that question was so reasonable that we decided to explore the answer and developed simply .
in short , a sitable is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can move with your hand , they can perceive each other , they can capture their movements , and they have a screen and a funch .
more importantly , they &apos;re physically , why you can just move them out of building like the hands and access .
and the situation is an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data .
and when these tools are going to become physical and consciousness for their movements , recognize each other and perceive the humanities of our dealing with them , then we can start with explorati
i &apos;m starting with some simple examples .
this situation is configurated for the video , and when i &apos;m in a direction , the video is played forward , if i got him in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other .
so if i put them up next to each other , that &apos;s your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by another , they also notice that , and you can get something nervous .
and they also feel their movements and things .
and an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like coloring this with fluids .
in this case , we &apos;ve configured three sitables as a color map , and i can use them to get color in the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we exaggerate it , we can go back a little bit .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or logic games , where we give people the possibility of the fast extinction and want to see the results immediat
here i am ... this is a fibonacci consequence that i &apos;m creating with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words that &apos;s kind of a mixture of scrable and boggle .
basically , you get every round on every situation on every single letter , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re actually created about a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you have a new letter combination and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some children who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try it and recorded a video of it .
they &apos;ve really loved it .
an interesting thing about these kinds of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; gets words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are a couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest beta tester there in the bottom right .
it turns out he wanted to stack the sittable .
so for him , they were just buildings .
this is an interactive tricking .
we wanted to develop a meature for language leather .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by running the sittable of the table that shows this figure .
here he &apos;s letting the sun .
the sun is going up with the sun .
now he gets a tractor into the scene .
the orange other tractor .
good work ? yes !
by shaking the sittable , and she &apos;s going to put the characters to each other , you can interact the characters .
... invent its own story .
hello .
it &apos;s a story of open end , and he can decide how it &apos;s developing .
flying cat .
the last example that i have today to show it is a music sequence for live , which we &apos;ve developed recently and in the sittable as notes , like leadership and drugs .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose that you want to use .
and you can pick these notes into the sequence that you can attract in any patterns .
and you put them up by just keeping a ton seat to a sequence sentence .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a particular tone , and then you &apos;re talking about .
and then extraordinary effects like pace and strength that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting where we put the leadership in two sequenci sittible , and they arrange them in a series , they expand and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i &apos;m adding a base .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of things .
and now i connect the filter with the drug so i can take the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the speed in one or the other direction .
and now i connect the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can take the sequence while they &apos;re doing .
and it doesn &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but can improvise ; they &apos;re extending or short .
and finally , i can start the whole sequence by tending the loud-state seat .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new personal computer interfaces that are better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new world and some of the opportunities to show you what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you on the way is that we stand on the threshold of this new generation of tools to interact with digital media , which bring the information into our world that &apos;s
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to conversations with you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , what &apos;s biohacking ?
i &apos;ve got to stop a little bit , and that &apos;s what biohacking is engaging with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been studying me for a few years now with the biohacking , and that &apos;s what i started , because i wanted to know more and make it most impo
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to be kind of closer to the matter , like this .
i think that molecular biology in general is now , so generally , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
it &apos;s extremely important now , and it &apos;s much more important , and much more importantly , is going to be more important in the future .
there &apos;s so distinctive things like these entire genetically changed plants on the accounts .
there &apos;s now craig venter in the u.s. , who &apos;s trying to make biofuel , so gasoline from algae .
there &apos;s also things that are completely going on in the everyday what most people aren &apos;t aware of , for example , washing levels that allow us to wash with four degrees of washes are als
and the list you can continue endless .
and so from the interest in this one of this technology , i &apos;ve continued to continue .
what &apos;s why now ?
most people know that from the software area .
computers , and then it &apos;s going to always break in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claw data and so on .
that &apos;s kind of sad for the hacker scenes , because that &apos;s not meeting what she actually started , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s what the software hackers , in the &apos; 70s , eighty years with computer basis , and that &apos;s what the internet came out .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be an access problem that simplifies like things , so an any problem , a question , and how to
and there &apos;s been the way with software , but there &apos;s also in the electronics , and there &apos;s also a whole burst level that do with electronics circles are doing all sorts of driving 
and now there &apos;s also towards biology , and that &apos;s where i want this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , because biology is actually an abstract code , which is , because it &apo
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program , and you can actually hack it , and that &apos;s what i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot of deeper with it .
it &apos;s actually a two-thousand eight really shape , these networks .
there &apos;s hackeria dot org , which is originally from switzerland , that &apos;s with europe and with a cooperation in india based network , but now members or active people everywhere in the wo
that &apos;s a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists to deal with these technologies and process the creative , there &apo
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find such a locker access to having a playful dealing with it .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself biom dot there .
this is from the u.s. a network , which is actually more like that kind of forum where you &apos;re making , and discusses online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit more business , and then there &apos;s something like this , you know , applied questions .
and out of these networks that made the entire popular , has developed a scene that i wanted to portrait .
here in the picture on the top , you see biocurious , which is a hacker space , so basically a school , a private school , a private school , nonprofit institution , where everybody can go .
children , old , all sorts of people are going on there to just get the lab and look at what you can do when these laboratory protocols .
there &apos;s a group on the lower left is a group in indonesia , house-of-natural fibers , which is , but there &apos;s pretty long .
longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also engaging in an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , and combine that in a pretty distant way .
one group of ankara that i &apos;ve ever learned in front of a while , which is a student group that would like to convey the public what they learn in the university , and they &apos;ve tried to ex
and i &apos;ve got up in the other picture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition to the subject .
and that &apos;s , you know , that &apos;s mostly young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually using is this fascination at technology .
and what you can do with it , and what you &apos;re talking about is , okay , what do you know , what do you want to do , you &apos;ve got interested in bringing you with this ?
so , ok , to hack biology , you &apos;ve somehow needed material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
in fact , what you usually understand under a lab , that &apos;s so sort of tracking machines , extremely distanted , extremely distanted , just for surgery , trained academics with ph.d. and so on 
and our approach was to say , ok , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each every coffee automat has actually higher developed technology than most lab devices , that &apos;s really like this .
and so with this premise , with this premise , then , for example , brian degger in england tries to put together a minimal lab and then taken this kind of struggling pressure , a heat place , and ,
so everybody who &apos;s been dependent on a soup that he left too long , even done .
i then tried to expand this in my lab at home , and then i bought some second-hand equipment on ebay , and then made a little bit of dna analysis , trying to make a paternal test , so that &apos;s w
now that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , but now .
there &apos;s the bottom in the picture , you see the lab , in leadership , so there &apos;s such an opposite garage with also so possible laboratory that the university has measured , and pretty in
and this is biocurious , who &apos;s also mentioned hackers &apos; space , this yeah , such a kind of policy school basically for molecular biology .
and so , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relative heterogens , so that &apos;s holding of people who do this alone , to greater organizations , which holds the more formal in the institutionaliz
but always the approach the approach that it should be easy and accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group when we were aware of ourselves , ok , so we &apos;re here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are always ch
and then you came from the do-it-yourself website of the founders , and i said , ok , we &apos;ve got to meet real y , and then organized two events , one in london , two thousands of ten , and shor
and then it was also about that , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what is our goal , our basis ?
and then we &apos;ve been expanding a code-of-conduct .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just the wishes , his and what &apos;s moving him , expressed , then .
and that &apos;s where i think , is a good code .
and then we &apos;ve got them connected , but that &apos;s yes , i think , it &apos;s been relatively well , people are really convinced by this .
and we &apos;ve even tried to bring it back to the academia world , but it &apos;s kind of not like that .
so i think we &apos;re out of the biohacce sence in the view , even a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what projects we &apos;re going to do ?
one project i made with the hacketeria network in switzerland was that we wanted to build something called optical cases or optical pincets .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser beam , on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then moving in that focus , so that &apos;s just like such a tracking t
this works really , this is going to work in the academic setting , and we thought , ok , well , we may have taken a webcam that goes up , then you have a microscope that &apos;s growing up about 40
that &apos;s what you see .
and then we &apos;ve put a dvvd burner , and then the burner went out the laser , and then trying to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
another project that &apos;s from the french group out of the french group out of paris , and that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s got like this , like this , such a brain wave measurement , something like this , so he &apos;s been engaging with neurobiology , his nickey is sam neurohchie .
he then built this one of this helme , and in the cooperation with the museum , that was running .
and then they were able to go into the room , put it on this chair , put this helmet .
then their brain waves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , then they &apos;re different lights in the room .
it &apos;s a pretty sending project .
another thing from the united states that has also to do with this fathernity story about this , is the p.c. , that &apos;s the polymera chain reaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes to replicate , dna , fragments , so you can make it visible .
so if i &apos;m doing this that the profilers are going on , then they go , collects any hair samples , and then they make that method , and then they can say , ok , this hair belongs to this people
and the machines that are doing something like this , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you buy commercially , the cheapest goes down in a thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbies , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot .
so that &apos;s just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got two bustes and said , ok , we &apos;re doing simpler and cheaper , and then freely available hardware , electronics things , that this device combined , and now the ones the ch
i think somehow six hundred dollars or something like that .
but at any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s actually in a framework where it &apos;s clearly available .
so i think it &apos;s a very comfortable hack .
a project i started building last was to build a gene gun .
it &apos;s gene gun , like this kind of air pressure , which is going around so far , two centimeters or something .
you &apos;re putting dna on the gold particles and the gold particles then into these air printing postures , and then i shot them on journeys , and then brought them together with that .
so the device that you see is that didn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s so my prototype , which looked pretty distraction , so one of these , the thing on it , the thing on it , and that was high , and that was high , the thing was high , the thing was 
and then i took a sand donor , and that &apos;s what &apos;s looked at it .
a sending dot when you make the full with water , the enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s going to be about two of the time .
and so you can then accelerate the particles strong enough , and then they &apos;re also going into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros out or something like that , sanding ponds like that .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically powerful .
and that &apos;s actually the nurturing of the scene right now to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the understanding that more people can engage .
because at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively very little idea of it and also no chance to form them .
because , if you read about it , from second-literature , that &apos;s not the same as you made it ourselves or seen it .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you also want to meet sense of informed citizens in the society and want to be able to talk about , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it to make it and understand it .
and that companies under the words open knowledge and citice science .
so that you &apos;re a citizen that you &apos;re going to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the concrete from the biohackers .
these are the people who got into at least officially on the website , diy-bio-bio-do-org website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interestingly , they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s i think that there are less people that are actually existing .
so i know from some who didn &apos;t get in .
and that &apos;s just the biohackers , the individual people .
and partly with these hacker spaces , so these places come together .
and that &apos;s at the beginning .
as i said , it &apos;s only started .
and hackerspace , which is the computer hackerspace , because the cob base in berlin was the first , new hundred fine .
and this now has become a giant network of very good , yes , infrastructures that are represented everywhere in the world .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to spread up , and then we &apos;re similarly connected , so that there are more people could be involved .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and try every one of themselves .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible when you &apos;ve got there enough curiosity and put enough energy , then you get far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
that &apos;s a question that moves me very much as a designer , but also in the area of usability and before all the things in the area of usand experience .
it &apos;s about how to use people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make them a possible satisfying experience .
because i think that the interactive media address us archian , cognitive models , so paradigms that have been programmed in our biological memory ago , and that we can just create these interactive
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this high technology that you &apos;re interested in , but in fact , the future brings into the future , but in fact , the future is
what &apos;s because now , archaic models ?
i &apos;ve written four sticks , and i &apos;d like to explain to be quickly .
to archaic cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve been involved in pre-industrial times .
these archaic models heard that we have a principle natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds unusual .
and i &apos;m going to go back to that , and i &apos;m going to prove you to try to prove that they have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to do because of these archaic models of these archaic models , although we &apos;re using a codificated language today .
and the third area which explains is actually by itself .
we all know that the interactive media is non-linear , which includes the denition of the linearity , and what of course says that we feel linearity today .
the fourth point is that the story is a place of information passenger .
so how about the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove to you this .
how many doors have the house that you live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen at the moment .
you go through this house through this house where they live , and look at how many doors are .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they &apos;re virtualizing reality and they &apos;re virtualizing without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to give you the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.c. lab , and we can actually get that all the time .
and this fortune to virtualize reality , that people in the pre-industrial times were also needed , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have photography .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had was her head .
and in this head , the memory played .
in this head , knowledge , and with these virtual images , the imagination , they were passed also .
and so it &apos;s also so powerful in us that we can deal with virtuality .
and the interesting thing about this is when i &apos;m going to make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going on .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time , human producer and medium was itself .
now , if you think about a piece .
what &apos;s media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
but that &apos;s the same thing to talk again .
essentially tool of the information has been for early stories .
shaman , priests , so-called knowledgers , were extra to prevent knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very powerful to stories .
the author of the book , the storytelling animal , jonathan godsis , we still have a thousand hours with the reception of stories .
that means for a kid who spent it to achieve that the great year of his life has spent most of his life with the reception of stories .
now we think our love of stories depends on that we have seen as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
that &apos;s a lot back into the cultures of the industrial times .
but for me , in the area of interactive media , as particularly impressive , we &apos;ve been interested in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
i &apos;ve brought you an example by the north american tribe from the nootak indian .
and the lives lived in the coast of british columbia .
and as you can see , that &apos;s a very island area , and you had to navigate them somehow , from island to get food .
and they did this with so-called lead maps .
you might know that , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in this , from the australian individuals .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead maps , but they have used the so-called songline , or the dream path .
and what the interesting thing about is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be trained about songs .
and where the language was underlying supported range .
that is , you navigated sounds and rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythms have the geology , the topography of a region , and of course , that you could defrage these songs and put it together into the left , and it could move back to th
so why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top of about to ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what happened there ?
it &apos;s the so-called machine age .
we &apos;ve moved before in something called the great age .
it &apos;s the machine age , and happens is the book and happened is the photography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and that their own production of our individual memories have been supplied to external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we &apos;ve lost a piece of god &apos;s piece of virtualizing .
virtuality has become stranger for us and doesn &apos;t have anything to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the brighton university , is so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the picture , not the television , that these mass media have bee
let &apos;s make a little between balance .
from the edge age to the machine age .
what has influences on our thinking and our memories ?
and then the influences of the industrial cultures are .
and they &apos;re going to be more over the centuries , and more through the impacts of the machine age .
that means , instead of reminding us , we standardized , we standardized , in mass common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract of an abstract language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing anymore in pictures that things don &apos;t happen in pictures , but we &apos;re codificating our language .
we have used to things that things happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions like the non-linearity .
what we remained is the storytelling .
still , we &apos;re very , very powerful as an information instruction .
the question is , what &apos;s now ?
we had the equivalent of age , we had the machine age , and we &apos;ve got a called cyber age .
it sounds very sparkling , and it sounds very much science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber-age , which get us to discover these opportunities back to our skills .
this is about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearity ; it &apos;s about storytelling .
i want to explain that for a little bit .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so , if you look at google glass , for example , what makes us combine the virtual world with the real world , which means our afficient for virtualization , which is called the virtualization to fe
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , the relationship of my talk , of course , we &apos;re moving physically in not existing , virtual worlds , after the model of the holodeck .
and other examples are the ambients , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human intelligent .
all of that needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve graduated , and i hope that the video works , brought brought a very , very beautiful project , which is the backles of michael burk , and kathin  crince , joris class and jan-morite .
and the two things are here today .
maybe your short time you can stand up , so that you can talk about the two of the projects .
and this project i brought in as an example of how again in these archian , cognitive models are addressed .
this is a game i need to say .
what the storytelling is , of course , extremely , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;ve probably have that any people have people around consumers , or that they play with any console in the hand .
anyway , you &apos;re doing this inside .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s that i thought i &apos;ve discovered the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , with the real world .
and i apologize i have to shortcut so much .
you can actually explain that much better , there &apos;s a lot more behind them .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;m discovering a city by looking at what places were positive or negative .
and so i get a very different sight from the city , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones and positive zones in this way , and that &apos;s a very different virtual m
and we can love to look at that now .
oh , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you see in the same .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , yes .
and with a kind of pocket lamp , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this together my talk , and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the very age , and that we can activate us a little bit of
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked , whether this sack is a speaking sack and i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to solve what &apos;s inside .
but so far , i &apos;m going to do it a little bit curious .
yes , children are naturally curious or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creature of house , so , of course , with the issue of curiosity and how curios changes our thinking , and why are we lost curiosity and why are we lost curiosity and so on .
that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re engaging with actually besiness as a design .
if professors are curious , then they &apos;re often gone into the research semeters .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half year .
a research semetter , natural use uses design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why start to engage with so natural , archaic forms of communication , interaction and so on .
and i just hold one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become more intuitive , more and more intuitive , more useful , and you have to look at what is actually for us , of cour
and before the background , i &apos;ve designed in the area of natural our interface design , so the next generation into the transformation of human computers in the relationship of human computers
so i &apos;ve been busy with it , when , of course , when , of course , or intuitively .
you might have to look at that again .
why does that happen ?
so when we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s short , then we &apos;re going to move from the third into the fourth social generation or society form .
so from modern into the computing society .
every society is controlled by a primary measure .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through the language .
that means that you &apos;ve found a common language that you could communicate with each other , you could communicate into the same cave , or other areas , has created cities or villages and creat
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
also , you had to learn , so no small one can talk about , but we &apos;re learning it &apos;s naturally , of course .
that &apos;s when the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
and that was a giant strike , because , of course , the living language started manifesting in the form of script , which means what &apos;s fluid and alive , i started and mixel it in stone , and i
because after like myself , and when i circulate , it &apos;s a very different competition as if there &apos;s an alive sort of thing .
but successive then moved this script as a primary medium , received .
and then the next generation where we &apos;re actually still living primarily .
that &apos;s the pressure through pressure and print writing with guttenberg and others .
at the time , it was just as an africt where adel , cleans and others have said : because you actually start reading , then the people start reading , and that &apos;s completely fatal .
and now we get into the next generation and the exciting thing , such a generation is only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal phase that we &apos;re doing this .
and of course , that confuses us , because we see on the one hand the new media , social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what scans on the old , don &apos;t say that in last ng horses , and not beef or other phenomena , which i just want to take this and want to
and these two worlds can just think together , new and old .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computing society , very many mechanisms , principles and archaic paradigms from from tribal society .
but not on the local level , but it &apos;s on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not , if i think locally , ecologically , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , then this won &apos;t work .
that means that the local village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , possible , but also the total transparency .
as you know , at the time in the village , who was what &apos;s going on with whom , and when , that &apos;s what happens today about this extension of ourselves through these mobile endings on glob
it &apos;s that we know globally , and we &apos;re getting faster and more faster and better .
as earlier happened in the village on the village .
before the background , i &apos;ve been busy to look at this , which means that , of course , what &apos;s natural for us , what &apos;s also instinctive for us , so what &apos;s the difference ?
because often gets people , you can &apos;t do it usefully so everybody can deal with it .
so you &apos;ve got to engage with it , what does that mean , and not just changing that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to become better .
and of course , when , of course , is something intuitive , and how can i influence as a designer and design things so that they &apos;re useful , so possible , because they &apos;re fun and they &a
and then you &apos;re busy during the study , with the subject of perception and perception psychology .
and that , of course , is what you start and saying , okay , now i &apos;ll just look into the inner self .
and what &apos;s because there &apos;s actually there ?
so how do we work if we &apos;re going in there ?
and what means , of course , intuitively , and how our channels of the perception , and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs said time , you need to dig , understood the dear , understood how it works .
so you really have to look in the detail if i want to make something friendly or intuitively handwable , which means that in the core .
and that &apos;s what you see is that you &apos;re on our seven senses , most people think we have only five now , there &apos;s actually seven senses , and there &apos;s certainly the next one , an
and looking at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but it doesn &apos;t know what it means .
but i &apos;ve got to understand in core , understand in the creature , when will information to information , when when information will know from data information and from information , so i know 
and of course , how design impacts perception .
we &apos;re looking at this when i design things , then i can make them confusing as on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can actually design them to intuitive
so much more naturally , in a bunch , but i see directly , where is salt and pepper inside .
and when i say somebody , salt or pepper , he &apos;s going to think about where is what &apos;s inside .
and then on the left is just intuitive and then hopefully that not a sugar inside , there &apos;s no sugar inside the salt .
but also our perception itself , how it takes us .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks larger than that little , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re actually equivalent to our perception , and yet our perception is changing after what conte
does anybody know what that is ?
come on one .
pattern recognition should work .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s more likely to my glasses .
so it &apos;s circle .
a second circle starts to correlate or associate .
and when i get one of these halbobals , then we &apos;re not only seeing another unit , which is circle , circle , but we see an unit , we don &apos;t see anymore three parts , a circle , a circle ,
so that &apos;s what you call design law or design psychology that affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the designs , they have the most in the first semester , the great designs .
design people close , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and once in the third then , forgot about the third .
but that &apos;s an essential important thing , if you want to design things also , intuitively .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is that .
sounds first of all , but it &apos;s actually exciting when you &apos;re engaging with it .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes forward , and now you think we &apos;re looking back from the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re first seeing behind the back .
because they project an assumption that you see something you recognize , for example , circle .
that means we &apos;re just projecting ourselves before we see it that brings back to the back into our set , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got this cognitive feedback , you &apos;ve projected what you want to see .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t do it and says , &quot; it &apos;s really going to play again and sure you see if what you see is what you &apos;re looking at .
and then it goes back , and then it &apos;s going to see it .
so a very , very exciting process , like certain things , and what &apos;s going on for milliseconds to do these things .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
that &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who knows what .
does anybody look something like this ?
one dalmating , exactly .
once i saw that , that &apos;s a palmater in it , you know that .
they &apos;ll never forget it because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmater is .
now you &apos;re looking at the dalmating .
and further , now you &apos;re always looking at it .
that means i &apos;ve actually put them down to you , that you don &apos;t recognize pattern darin , but i &apos;ve conditioned within a shortest period of time to see this dog in this controlled pi
and that &apos;s this projection of seeing , feedback , see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m projecting forward that i see the dalmating .
i see the dalmating .
so very , very exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gray is not , but here in these rosan mass are actually going on .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
when i know something tokes three seconds until i sort of think of the present in the past loop , i can also bridge very well waiting times where i &apos;ve always engaged in three seconds .
that &apos;s only processing as the present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can bring very elegantly waiting at the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what takes 40 milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also an exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of time that you &apos;re in love .
that means , right , when you know this , look at what you look at how long , because i &apos;m not going to take away from what &apos;s going on .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions that we have .
that means , this first impression happens in a rapid speed how we perceive things .
and how we also see things what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re interested in the environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the designs are not only engaging with the issue of perceptions and neural processing or cognition , but , of course , with the subject of the human object relationship .
so how a human being according to certain things around .
there &apos;s once productively the practical functions , so the formal aspects or formal aspects .
there are signs of functions , where i know exactly where i have to actually go .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is somebody for such a little desk , where it &apos;s almost about what &apos;s going on , so horrible sums of money , even though it &apos;s not that
we &apos;re more likely on the symbolic , on the meaning level , which we &apos;re actually engaging with as a design , of course .
back to my actual subject , natural our interface and the topic , which , of course , is unability .
and usability is always , how can i reach a certain goal or how can a user in a particular use is possible to effectively and efficient and satisfaction to a goal .
that &apos;s more like that .
how can i do something possible usefully ?
i can use this directly , or i need this manual or i need the corresponding training for that .
and less usbal , or use friendly it is .
that i &apos;m designing this and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better handball .
you &apos;ve got to understand that .
and then , if you part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you look at that , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety percent of our software today is intuitive or not useful that the ipad in ma
and intuitive use is not only for apple that &apos;s an elementary economic factor , more elementary success , if i want to use technological devices to human beings .
why ?
because in the rule , we through this new kind of usebility , which is the natural user interface , for example , five times faster at our goal .
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classic software , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , only one hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably going to go home for four hours , but your employer or somebody already falls on how he &apos;s engaging it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a relative increase for us , of course , is a certain thing for us .
and when we &apos;re going to go on an age of the software , here are the first commands line interfaces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next things came up with &quot; neuronal model or mental model , such as the software eregonomists said , &quot; which was an idea of something the metaphor , the metaphor , the metapho
so no longer zeros and ones or cryptic codes , but there &apos;s a metaphor .
and that made that already useful , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of graphic use surfaces works very much more with behavior .
so , as a design , i designed a lot more of the behavior than that .
that &apos;s such a paradigm shift .
that once at the time , that this is always more important for success , just the usability is going to be an application .
and when i go one step further into these natural our interfaces , where i &apos;m in per voice , language , by touch , the gesture and no longer person , and cursor to drive things , then i &apos;m
but this leads me again to the point , when will things are going to be intuitive ?
if you become more intuitive , and then i have to stretch my little friend here and look , what does that mean from view of view of cognition , when is really something intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always intuitive for us humans , if i &apos;ve got to think about it a little bit about it .
so he doesn &apos;t love to think , but it &apos;s going to make it relatively easy .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means if we can look at the existing action models from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can make this use as a creator .
that means i can transmit an intuitive , human action to a software and make the software that makes software friendly .
imagine the question , of course , what &apos;s actually the most intuitive action of us humans , and now i &apos;ve been talking about it .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the model .
that uses each one of us and ostic is an acronym and stands for orienting , selecting , transacting .
that makes every one of you all the time , but it makes it unconscious , and yes , intuitively or partially instinctively .
the model is happening in the womb , and is interculturally , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time without that most people have known that most people have known that mos
on the time , it &apos;s about five to 10 thousand times from us to activity , so you &apos;ve determined that it &apos;s then stranged as much often than a day .
i can now orient this mental action model , selecting , information , transactions transmits to an interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the desktop , now not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of an action pattern , an action principle .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of use friendly than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop .
and when i transmit this now , for example , where i &apos;m going to be overlooked as a choice , informing as a choice , i can look at me in the details , and yes , i can look at this somewhere or 
then i can transmit the whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this in an example .
yes , everybody has eaten pies .
overwhelm , i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , can zoom out again .
i &apos;m going to get the whole overlook , now can filter on this , and can say , just show me all the things with chocolate , for example .
and once at once , an interface , which is essentially more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach the things like the pieces , and they come to me , is more natural than when hierarchical organized websites or other mechanisms are able to do these things accessible .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and with this sentence , i would like to close , and again , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in that sense , i thank
i &apos;d like to help you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
the first thing when you &apos;re larger as a kid , as baby , is that you care about what kinds of divorces you have , right , and depending on whether your parents have allowed to play more or less
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why everybody who are here and curious are , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
and i &apos;m going to do it right now , practically this whole environmental discussion , world discussion , four years of club-of romes , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and that depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day they &apos;re giving them , they give scales about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus every day .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could only come through the world &apos;s ocean .
in fact , if we didn &apos;t take phosphorus and put the phosphorus .
and astonishingly , we &apos;re here with something , which would be actually meaningful , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years of phosphorus , and now through the phosphorus management in the world , brought into the environment than it &apos;s used in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousands of tons of urans have been distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take it all .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little bit less damaging .
so , for example , protect the environment , less car .
protection , make less waste .
protect the environment , use less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like i would say , protect your child , it &apos;s only three times instead of five times .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
when we think about the weight of the way , then our entire earth will become a peace or later .
that &apos;s why thinking about the way to think about .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first of all .
on the ground , over 60 percent of carbon is stored .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and lose between 11 and 30 kilograms per hectare , or the square meter also .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than new educates .
and of course , we can look at the waste problem , of course .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , for example , there &apos;s 20 percent of the garbage of the garbage .
and because we &apos;re older , they &apos;re going to get larger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the processional stage .
yes ?
one baby needs about six thousands .
and of course , we could reduce this to 10 percent , but what does that make ?
it &apos;s going to balance in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely unfortunate .
so the question is , how are we going to do with these ?
here , by the way , men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going on in the pigs about the first components of extrements .
the people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , right ?
traditionally , we think in the environmental discussion , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you try to exist people who when you say that , if you say , that &apos;s better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , then you &apos;re going to get rich and hostile .
and somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilizing the human population .
in israel , when you save a human life , you save the earth .
here it says that the more you kill , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
when you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants were about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody likes termites , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means that the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re physically working a lot harder than we , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , energy consumption is a little three-billion 
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re looking at how far we &apos;re aware of what we wanted to achieve and could , and how sad we are that we &apos;ve got a program , for example , you can see that , for example 
you can be climate neutral if they don &apos;t exist ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a climate neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means that we want to be dumber than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
fortunately , right ?
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem in trees .
there &apos;s still six hundred billion trees alone in the amazon .
you &apos;ve heard some of overpopulation problems from trees ?
that is , all of our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most strictly biomas -- agriculture doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolic products .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back in circles every year .
and we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s alone .
that means that we feel so guilty on the earth that we &apos;re saying . there &apos;s no bioland , no nature e-prograss , and as they all mean that allow our own experiments back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re many .
it &apos;s sure to be less damaging what oil use is .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it goes around the environment , the highest one is not to be there ?
zero emissions , yes ?
you can only have zero missions if they &apos;re not there .
even if they were shooting , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we make agriculture in brazil in where we &apos;re going to return the nutrients .
we can get directly in this way of getting nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we take directly the waste .
in china , you have a newspaper today , so you know , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
that means that the whole western civilization story draws by that the city has always taken , but given the farmers never something .
and what the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to the cities , and the cities had to keep further away their nutrients .
so all the western empires are always expanding until they didn &apos;t do the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re imploded .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done incredible civilization over five thousand years , because you were always able to bring the nutrients back .
even today , if you invited for the food , you expect after the food that they &apos;re so long until they look at the toilets .
because it &apos;s inhinity to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat , not for nutritional steel .
that means you can see the internet how to win the nutrients back .
that &apos;s actually beautiful about this , if you do that , so agriculture , biogas creates , on a hectal country with five thousands of people in favelas , it can get a farmer about a thousand fi
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate is in the favelas around ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , possible to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can just give them .
that means that the crime rates are going back .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over hundreds of years , in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever sobbed .
you could simply ruin a liter of oil , and then the facility would be ruined for years .
don &apos;t find it .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , possible to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , they write in germany , best of all the delivers of the statement is in frank .
unfortunately , not in open , but maybe you can help the frank forces a little bit .
because the frank force might be the phosphorus best .
and that must be back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s going down .
we &apos;ve been used in holland now over three years .
the cultural government has explained , they will be the first country in the world what phosphorus gets back .
but we need that totally .
understand , there are two countries controlling almost 70 percent of the phosphorus communities around the world .
there &apos;s an opec a bunch of orphans .
that &apos;s six-year-old countries that control 500 percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil we &apos;re going to replace through other energy carriers .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s especially first to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about effectivity , not about efficiencies .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad when you &apos;ve currented them , and they come with 40 pounds .
completely inefficient .
but what &apos;s effective , right ?
or take a lip pen .
a woman in germany is about six command in three kilograms of their lives .
that &apos;s going on .
this isn &apos;t really correctly correct because we don &apos;t know how much of these is going to pick up .
but a lippins , even from that lighting , i can tell you is completely inefficient , but that &apos;s effectively , yeah ?
anything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but effectivity .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better and put it up with it , and putting it in the burning facility to lose the whole materials for circulations , but first to ask , how do you close the circulations ?
imagine mozart efficiently .
yes ?
when i invite you for dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tablet with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you &apos;re in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that is , everything that counts in life , it &apos;s not about avoiding .
the whole environmental discussion .
we say people , oh , you don &apos;t have any environmental consciousness in the south .
no , which is throwing is exactly the right , yes ?
every point where you throw , from , yeah , you create life opportunities .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
as we think about northern .
there every footprint is disadvantage .
if they walk , yeah , every footprint is destroying the ground .
because the ground is going to die of the ground , and the wind and the water is waking up the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the way .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint that &apos;s going to be a wetlane .
not guilt management .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but when i ask them , how about your wife ?
so what do they say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , &quot; heart individual , &quot; yes ?
that &apos;s the minimum .
so don &apos;t save , avoid , avoid .
every waste is nutrient .
and it &apos;s a run , if you can see in italy , how people in the high bow , the next coladoses out of the car , that &apos;s what it is .
because you know , that &apos;s a full process .
it &apos;s the form of revival behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice crement , for example , that &apos;s next temperature &apos;s liquid .
they can switch off where they go and stand .
in two hours , she &apos;s building everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they throw through the biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there &apos;s two cycles .
it &apos;s not all of course to be compostible .
one television or a washing machine , which you &apos;re using , they don &apos;t use them .
it &apos;s just the things that experience like shoes , like streams , like automobiles , they have to be that they &apos;re going into biological systems .
the things that are just used , go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , right ?
it &apos;s very direct advertising , not for the company puma , but for you to help this business , make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
so , if i invite you for eating and saying that &apos;s free of high , then they don &apos;t help you .
no , we realize what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all what &apos;s inside is useful .
that &apos;s the first shoes that you can put the cavalization on the pedestrial room and go the gumb in biological cycles , right ?
everything is compostible .
and if we &apos;re doing , of course , for adidas , for nike , for hinging and marriage and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half the water problems around the world that &apos;s caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to help with , ask the people .
hey , puma , does you really seriously ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice already twice .
and i &apos;m not so sure if you &apos;re really going on .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going on .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been represented .
that &apos;s going on .
so we can make things like this now that if you break , if you break , you can go into biological cycles .
technical cycles are exactly the same .
there &apos;s a direct background for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , which is made in going back to the circulation .
so even that , so in each store , you can get things back .
when you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the change ?
when it &apos;s the garbage at the moment .
all around these , these transformations are almost .
in the countries , where people come to money .
because it &apos;s on the deponition , but else in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so that he can go into biological systems , if we change the water stores , inside that they can come back to cellulose , then they can plant hundreds of trees with a baby
yes ?
if you take these things , you &apos;ll sterilize it , sterilize and take the polder to plant trees .
this is the baby of carbon for the whole life , already from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need climate neutral , we can be climate .
it &apos;s sort of a beneficial poop .
yeah , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything .
i founded an institute .
there &apos;s a lot of people working on there , and they can all work .
there &apos;s extra one , cradle to cradle , where everybody can make up .
so no longer savings , avoid , reduce , reduce , not a major management , but smart management , but intelligent waste .
does it make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreting .
music as a language .
in the description to my talk , written that i &apos;m as an interpretinn , so in the english word , understanding .
interpretings are translators of the written notes in sounding music .
that as a translator doesn &apos;t just translate word for word to the text into a different language , but also has to understand the deeper sense of the words and correlation to have to understand
you know , translate from german into the english , more knowledge can require it even when it comes to poetry or about poetry .
but it &apos;s really stranger , but it &apos;s for lain that we &apos;re doing with our music language .
and as an interpreting of a music , i first have the written notes .
they think that the composer has written in the grades exactly everything he &apos;s going on .
in reality , the notes are very variety and uncomfortable .
these notes are about the same exact or exactly like a verbal , when very seemingly substantially , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape description , the purpose of the flowers isn &apos;t to smell the size of the flowers that only doesn &apos;t hear the pills of the wind , not feeling the pills of t
that means that the interpreter must translate this incredible process of the note language into another , which is translating hearible , concrete non-verbal music language .
today , i &apos;d like to translate what otherwise i want to translate musically , so interpreting again , translate into a verbal language .
so practically , translation is translation .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to put it on german , because if i had to translate it again in the english , it would be equal to me to translate the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me , as the spoken language works .
the notes have the function of the letters of a writing .
so it &apos;s not enough to read , just learning notes and press them on the piano or the right place on a villanisation .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the letter , you realize if you can see the language .
so for the learning process of music &apos;s learning process of music language as long as long as for the spoken language .
there &apos;s also destinctions whether you &apos;re learning for the homework , only passively understands , or you can talk to the musical world language .
the work of the interpreting is similar to starting like a theater director .
after you &apos;re first looking at a piece of playing because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re first to research for backgrounds of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the secondary literature .
you read in the letters , diarys , notes , or if there &apos;s words , thoughts about the composer themselves .
you study the works that he &apos;s been composing before and after .
you put comparisons .
the motions of writing it .
how and what did he feel ?
how were his circumstances like the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in .
you think you &apos;re thinking , for example , by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also got an interpret about the composers you &apos;re playing more and easier to think and feel easier to think about it .
the composer is becoming more and more to the friend that you &apos;re living with .
his cause to write the piece , it &apos;s getting more and more to my personal concern to play it .
because now the notes record everything else as an exact record of the composer , but just a framework , i &apos;m going to take that framework to fill it back with meaning and meaning .
i then say with my own words , which might be written between this framework .
i &apos;m explaining what these sounds could have .
now for me and for the composer then , and what you could mean for him today .
every song , every phrase is going to get a sense because i feel it myself , because it &apos;s now personally lived .
it has to be in here and now , otherwise , i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my concern .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i may have the experience , the piece that i was working on as long as i &apos;ve been working on .
how to experience a happy new day again , even though with the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , going to work , so experiencing the same piece always become the same piece over and over again
i &apos;ve become older that the seasons , my pulse goes slower than the morning , in a concertral case , it takes longer that the sound comes back than your home .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
all of that is affecting me and all of that affects my experience with the composition .
and wonderfully , if i stand with a duo partner on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , entered conversation .
you bring a new idea , and it &apos;s going to be an answer with a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we didn &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t sample .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and then the audience has experienced how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like that .
i can &apos;t play as play as in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why my palettes of the music sounds have much more colorances in emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to go out some colors , but to get new ones for that .
have a nice concrete example .
it was on a piano cussion in my loved old teachers , professor young and , a famous beethoven specialist , concert pianist and long-term professor of music school here in studgart .
unfortunately , i &apos;ve been too young so that he was already emergized when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune to meet him with about 13 years , and so i was already my school to my school .
i was 17 , when i was participating on one of his classes , and i played the last one of the four balloons of chopin , one late .
he asked me , what was the introduction of these ballads for me .
that &apos;s kind of a curious part .
and in my youth , i said expectation .
that &apos;s where he said , and he said , &quot;
that has to be the ancient difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he &apos;s been about sixty .
well , with you , you have dreams of dreams , but not meaningful memories .
i &apos;m going to play the piece today back for every few years , and it &apos;s transformed for me , although not a single note changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example of this from a very different area . monet has painted the season .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but the same garden , but different days , in different lights .
he translated the seasons as he saw them , as you &apos;ve seen in that moment on him .
his personal impressions of the seasons .
the six-mile interpretation of a piece is comparable .
because i &apos;m already as a choppin with two three-years ago when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s only lived only 20 years .
and i &apos;m important to look again into the notes , even though i mean they can memory them .
to keep the direction , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about the same as long as the spoken language .
often , the music class is that you &apos;re just learning to read the grades .
you learn practically first to read before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the sounds to the notes on the instrument .
when all the fingers in time , and right as they &apos;re going into the notes , then they come out , then they sound like music .
when the mistake happens , the student gets the next piece of the student .
the interpretation is barely talking about in the beginning .
all right , there &apos;s the front presto , which is a quick piece .
lento , slow .
loud and sheep shoes , and b , et cetera .
that &apos;s what most people here .
but also , when you put these tasks , there &apos;s still a little bit of technical .
and yet , it &apos;s always no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you &apos;re often forgotten something very elementary .
and that , to make music on the instrument , your musical and feel there before .
that &apos;s what singing .
a child that didn &apos;t learn singing because the parents didn &apos;t have , it &apos;s not going to do it yourself .
it &apos;s like speaking learners .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experience and idea of the music to bring it across another opportunity to bring about an instrument to sound .
people who have never sensed , they &apos;ve never felt their own body , as it &apos;s like to form a tone .
it &apos;s a phrase with his own breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocators to sing , our hands and feet .
that &apos;s how my fingers in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the melody creates from the singer and the rhythm from the dance .
the continuous responsibility today with music is not profound .
you don &apos;t need music to make music when it &apos;s going to be bored .
no longer needs to whistle or singing .
every own music is going to make if you &apos;re going to be somewhere from the outside with music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
that &apos;s what i ask , can &apos;t you sing , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or because they didn &apos;t learn how to sing ?
it &apos;s not too late to start with it to find out whether they can &apos;t do , or learning how to use these little muscles that are using the voices , right .
because that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got them that they &apos;re uncomfortable .
and then i ask , how competent was this diagnosis ?
did you have a second or third , as you &apos;re going to say it today ?
or , you don &apos;t like , you don &apos;t like music , and that &apos;s why they want to do with it .
but what i was going to regret , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can still convince them .
well , so you see , they don &apos;t have to be an opposite candidate .
but they don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and then i respond , but surely you can tell if they like them or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t do food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get into classical music because they don &apos;t play any instrument .
listen and say if you taste them or not .
whether the music is hepping or sweet .
tell what they feel .
over time , they &apos;re also going to get the distinction , and they want a little bit more distinction in there or taste .
why am i going to ask from my audience that it &apos;s also listening ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
a work that you &apos;re never looking at has no force .
the food that &apos;s been cooked by a chef or a cook that has to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes .
so please listen to when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound tapent .
if in an environment , where the adults make active music or at least active music , grows up a child , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the child is playing , after a construction , instead of a blue flower .
and that sounds very different than before .
that was the very first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece that &apos;s been written by hundreds ago , two hundreds ago , two hundred years ago ?
the instruments have developed .
there was no piano that the instrument didn &apos;t have a piano .
it wasn &apos;t yet invented .
i think that the beach would have been excited when he had the sound possibilities of today &apos;s modern channers .
i can today today the sounds that the beach has had on modern wings to sound what a barcoke can &apos;t do .
and also , by beethoven , he heard more than he had become dust .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play anything that &apos;s been rejected by the time than inflatable .
that &apos;s why the composers are dependent on us to reinvent the pieces .
so you &apos;re hearing about what they &apos;ve just considered in the mind .
and also , what you &apos;d think about today .
or what i imagine today because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what &apos;s never ?
have you ever been redical ?
and how did that feel ?
shoot .
i have a friend who drives a passeration .
when i come , with my little v piece and myself , it &apos;s going to get that feeling .
i shoot something through your head .
i say , &quot; well , what do you need this big car ?
and that &apos;s already lost half his values in the first year .
and at all , you &apos;re working a lot less than i work .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
and then immediately falls me immediately , that &apos;s just .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i &apos;m saying the word justice is this uncomfortable feeling .
our organism has invented a great way of bringing these uncomfortable feelings like neight to get disappeared .
and you can try that with words like rice , or winning , or something .
i want to explain something today with this mechanism today , which is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism is from lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lies , as you may have heard , when people say , nobody has to build the wall .
and then stones up , so that he &apos;s listening to them .
on such lie , you &apos;ll see that the liars doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check that he &apos;s got entirely different .
he just dises them and not yourself .
no , the lies i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with them to deliver themselves .
they need these lies to get a life life to get a self-deception .
they can bring them less like , yes , testing , or bring them to the pollution .
you need time .
from that time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter pablop picasso has once portraited a woman .
this woman has complained , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see you .
picasso : they only wait .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
at this point , and when you laugh , you recognize how important these lies is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a disturbed relationship to lie .
the artist divides something , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if it just looks in the mirror .
the artist divides something like that in a portrait like that , what you &apos;re first going to be familiar when you look at this work over and over again .
and then this uncomfortable feeling couldn &apos;t see it , and it &apos;s going to be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use lies as a great invention of the stabilitation of our lives .
and not just in the art , even in the people in mythology , in stories , it does back up .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked in the mirror , and asked him , who is because the most beautiful in the whole country ?
one day , the mirrors says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful thing .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much hostility out of this true footprint , even the mirror can &apos;t lie from this real experience .
but we should just be familiar with that you can &apos;t say a woman that there &apos;s a beautiful somewhere else .
here &apos;s needed to understand what we understand under political correctess .
we need this piece that &apos;s going to spend up the deception without which we can &apos;t live in .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in people &apos;s presentation , but in science , we have these great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of the worcester .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the department of the people .
that the person should get off the monkey and , yeah , at least a common ancestor , there were between people and monkeys .
and then she ran she ran them her husband , and she said , that &apos;s not true what charles writes there .
the human is going to get off the monkey or have a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people get knowledge of it .
why do we have to prevent that people know about something , if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these life .
because we have this self-deception , that feeling of being great , the great things about the highest creatures , not by one of these natabilities , like an organism , which exists yet , comparable
so , we can &apos;t deal with these things .
we need to prevent that people get knowledge of things , especially if they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism resolves and how the traces look like that leaves something else than this great image of ourselves , i want to get you another story .
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife tells me .
she came from school , she &apos;s teacher , and she told her from a student .
an autistic student .
she likes to like it especially because he &apos;s got a property to help up .
and she asked him , what are your hobbys ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m with the fireman .
and because i &apos;m interested in the fire , i &apos;m interested in protectical things .
yeah , you feel it , when you &apos;re header at this point . there &apos;s something there .
i said to my wife , whenever a human in a moral justice is used the words because we should try to replace it through the words .
they do that , and then they experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in pyrtechnical things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the fortune .
it &apos;s a little bub who doesn &apos;t interest in fire .
it &apos;s interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no units that we can look around where you learn how to learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fireman .
he &apos;s signed up .
and everywhere , you &apos;re not telling his teacher that you like to put somewhere somewhere , and you &apos;re excited when the fire is uploaded .
no , it &apos;s just much better if we show that we &apos;re continuous to refer the dangers that others are creating when they &apos;re putting fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
and that providence that the inside of the bub already knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the monscious things that you can do something and the things you know that they look very differently , so they design that they can look much 
so there &apos;s some words that we also emerge in the language of politically correctly talking about .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know when we talk that , the social relationships are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
i &apos;m going to give you what we &apos;ve found out in my institute .
after what logic this deception , this self-deception , the willingness , another reality than the ones that we &apos;re actually in unconscious about spreading outside .
here , i want to present two , perhaps three examples .
the first example of what many of you know and appreciate some of them , very little at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something that says something that says about leificine .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not by stop , material nature .
and when they have people who are the final beliefs that they own a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been done by the soul to life , then that &apos;s just like the soul sort of sort of
and from that soul , you &apos;re thinking that somehow in this cloudy nature , in this funny nature , anima is it in the latin , the air skin , present .
and when this air came across humans , he &apos;s filled with the people , with mind , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul is doing .
so it &apos;s supposed to come in from the outside to people .
so we should perceive them as something that &apos;s necessarily to be present for our lives .
and when you have this assumption , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re lucky to experience our world through a lie .
because now they can apply a trip .
they &apos;re still known from school .
now this is a distribution here that describes a logic .
this is the most difficult part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness .
that &apos;s what you can just apply that logic .
there &apos;s three sentences in that three .
the first sentence is class , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is when claw has right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was participating it his particular .
a third sentence that &apos;s immediately coming in people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say , who has no soul , which is dead , and you can &apos;t argue .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic on this , yeah , in this decepting talk to the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
because i can claim everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
i can say the man &apos;s a man .
and when i &apos;m right , the driver is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the dentist is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about what &apos;s going .
i can argue everything .
but it &apos;s critical if i have right , there &apos;s been .
so when claus says there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logically correct .
and now our consciousness immediately feels like this , you can do something about it .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and prevented .
because actually , we need to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which is easy to use it that two sentences are logically correct , and a third thing that looks like he &apos;s going to do something with that , so we can save our lives .
so , we &apos;re doing as if it &apos;s actually impossible without living a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a whole modern example that &apos;s filling over and over again .
you have to have another philosophical topic , a broken burner from philosophy , presents .
that &apos;s what we go back into the decade century .
there was a scholar that &apos;s called johannes buridaus , and after that &apos;s the buridan essel .
the buirdian enel is an esland that &apos;s made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
it &apos;s such a nature .
and if you place the exact in the middle between two significant hearts , then he starves .
because he doesn &apos;t know which one should go first .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how the natural things are imagined .
more equivalent forces with opposite show each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only when you get another example , so if it immediately makes you bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason , and nothing about it .
automatically he goes to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of driven in nature , and determined by the bigger piles that attract you immediately , they also have the feeling that there must be something like a
and if we &apos;re also here in france at main , i remember the max planck institute for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholar that &apos;s called the wolf singer , and from him sometimes they say sometimes there &apos;s sometimes there &apos;s no willing .
now , we can form the second sentence , and can say when wolf singer right , he doesn &apos;t have any will freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read almost every day in the day newspaper , which you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like this , who can &apos;t have any willingness , it can &apos;t be moved for his actions and claims to responsibility , and it &apos;s incredible capable .
again , they have it again .
actually , you &apos;d have to prove that if there &apos;s something like willing .
but the logic of deception is allowing us to do this , as if the first sentence of the first sentence of it wrong , that you would have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just want to do something , if you want to do something , if you want to test something , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to lie .
for example , if you meet a person that you can say , there &apos;s no predictions .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predictors , which is prophet .
you can &apos;t call them , that would be a little bit of politically incorrectly .
tell , there are no predators .
immediately , they &apos;re going to experience one that you &apos;re going to experience , of course , that you can &apos;t prove .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because as they &apos;re busy with it , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predictions , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he did it .
because he led them on a drive where he doesn &apos;t stop themselves .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s only interested in holding yourself before the need to prove that there are predictors .
so , in the kind of shifting evidence , they &apos;re experiencing the great of lie .
and again , if you have an opportunity to feel that thing in other people , they do , because they &apos;re going to make others happy , when they don &apos;t remember them in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to wonder if i can mention it .
and she &apos;s one of the reasons here from this great event , and i asked me if i was going to have a talk and give my idea here .
i have to say that , you &apos;ve mitched it , it was difficult for me to talk about my idea .
and i may think of my island project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum thing , of course , is a lot of ideas .
i &apos;m likely to belong , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generations that got this bad ecol image , because i started studying engineers in case , technical gr
and i &apos;ve been suggesting in the middle of the 80s because i wanted to make renewables , and there was no career room .
there was the core research plant .
they meant all the face at that time , also that was cap .
they &apos;re called projects today .
because a good engineer has either great cars or nuclear plants .
but something like &quot; solar point , &quot; from which is kind of hundred watts out of the square meter , and that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful that he &apos;s retailed the word again because after the wall , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything was bad .
however , that wasn &apos;t like that in the age 18 .
and there was something that there was self-assembled alternative places , and one of them was sitting in crusberings in the more marriage foot where you suspected the evil .
and that &apos;s what terrorism is , but that was called well-tronic and has made solar energy , and i started in the middle of the 80s .
and yes , many of what &apos;s been said today , me very touches me , because many , many beautiful expressions that i was living through .
i &apos;ve worked in the collectively 11 years in the collective , that was basis democratic .
we were 20 people .
when one was no , the vettoprinciple was completely brought , and i &apos;ve been despited to see if my father always wasted , because all the colleagues of my father always went to him , you &apos;
it &apos;s engaging with growing .
and that was really , really , very , very bitters , and you &apos;re going to come into the near phase , and that appeared a picture of where i asked me after 10 years , thousands of marks , of cou
and i &apos;ve stopped it up to six times , and then with friends , we &apos;ve become the companiers of the company , which then with the spin-ff  cells , which is one of the greatest cell manufact
a huge success story , but also , of course , we have the problem of a growing business , and we &apos;re going to have two thousands , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start back a
and i &apos;ve brought you a project that i want to imagine with you now .
and the title of the talk was , yeah , as you come to hundred percent renewables .
and we &apos;ve just started to ask with a relatively simple crazy story , where would you actually use a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of graciose on the acors .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have a renewable energy community of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
that &apos;s just not technologically .
if you build each other , the system is starting to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians when you go in berlin aleleshow .
they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but doesn &apos;t think we have seven percent , and our web is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent percent , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , calculated this was two thousands , in the first contacts started with the island , just take calculation .
how big because you had to be a battery so that you &apos;re going to be an island of 30 , 30 , 10 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewables .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go on again .
the conventional system looks like this around the world .
by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electric performance are built in the world .
that &apos;s really quickly everywhere , because that &apos;s especially quickly everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world that &apos;s happening is deleted with diesel , because you don &apos;t need to permission .
that &apos;s quick .
you put that one &apos;s net box .
and then it looks like this .
in that three of the diseases , three of the diseases are always waiting .
yeah , this looks like the down there is the read .
we &apos;ve also got very precise data .
and the winds of solar , or whatever it is , in the rule , a back up system , which can only embrace a system here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the dial is becoming back-up and the winds , suns are supplying the load that they can draw the larger share .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then they have to turn that diel .
that means that the moment you &apos;ve got to worry about that the renewables can take over the entire web .
and of course , if you &apos;re managed in some ways in some ways .
this hasn &apos;t done anyone in the world .
that &apos;s in the little style , so you can also serve your raisers about a little intervention .
people are always asking me , what do you research because there &apos;s actually there in closer ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to switch several of these challenges , and they &apos;re supposed to build a web , that &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 10 percent renewables , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last 10 , 10 percent renewable , which is going to work very , very expensive , and it &apos;s n
that &apos;s going to be an energy carrier that then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas you know , or she , that &apos;s going to be .
then you have to go more on a seasonal memory and winter summer , and not just day night .
we just wanted to know what is because with a normal , stinning electrochemical battery .
how far are you going to get ?
and then put a whole lot of simulations .
and wind and sun and come through the result , and came through the outcome , a very exciting outcome , which requires a middle electricity of about 50 cents a middle electricity of about 50 cents a
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the dial system when the display prize is going up a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the insulans .
what would everything have to be done ?
it &apos;s negotiated with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new societies .
we &apos;ve been only five people to build one to build the society .
and here again , the representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our systems also has a price of price , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to make 20 percent with diseases and also throw a prescription on the other things .
and the power utility , which is the electricity company in the island , has meant that we find great .
we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we &apos;re sort of like , the electric relationships of the island , can train one to three .
that means we &apos;ve first looking for the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , in the fall of japan .
and funny , it &apos;s in the &apos; 70s at bbc &apos;s hunger , and today , abd developed , and then became an accessible to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatt performance , and it can bring this performance long six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve got simulation technically out .
and then they did .
we also have one of these dieleged aggregates in the same size , as he &apos;s there , brought into the hall , to actually get the complete dynamic behavior of this net , so in the back , it &apos;s
over here , we simulate the whole transmission system , the kilometer physics of the cables , to train the vibration behavior in the net .
and here you can see again .
we can turn two hundred kilowatts photovoltaics on the web .
so here we see this again , we &apos;re going to see this disease , again , all the individual aggegates .
and what we &apos;ve done , since two thousands , the hell then done , until two tens of thousands of times , everything that &apos;s between the individual system of electronics to develop software
so we &apos;re not a battery mater , but we &apos;re defining as a company that &apos;s just between the issue of battery and the topic and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is , you know , on this island , you can basically take the problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , which is going to go and move at the moment , energy , how to go , on the island , for example , we &apos;ve got to get the wind and the sun .
of course , smart grid offers .
so smart grid , a giant topic everywhere .
we can begin to integrate electromobility , integrating electromobility , you can manage the load .
that is , if you &apos;re at 10 percent renewables , you &apos;re not going to do this without memory .
you can get through the smart grid , you can build through the nets , yes , that &apos;s what you should do , but you &apos;re never going to get completely completely related to memory .
and that &apos;s what the message is .
so a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see the problems you get .
if we turn that down , you don &apos;t have this rotating mass that causes a certain kind of drug on the net .
and our european connection is basically from loudering masses of great power plants , wherever the wave all around europe is spinning .
we &apos;re looking into this net , the fifty heart , and when it &apos;s going to get nine-year-old coma of nine heart , we &apos;re starting to make a few valves , and then we go back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly wearing .
if you travel that somewhere , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
the spinning reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net .
and in the time , they can respond to others .
if you don &apos;t have that , this rotating mass , then you have to replace that with performance electronics and electrochemistry .
and we can switch with this big battery two milliseconds once .
that &apos;s where you see what enormous speed opportunities there are .
and the message is , we &apos;ve got to get these rotating masses when we kind of get our goals of 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 percent , and so on , if we want to reach them at all .
then we &apos;ve got to develop our pattern run of capacity in the net .
mustarn run is simple , the power station runs with the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a giant debate right now , building from the coal power stations , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gas turbines , because that &apos;s not going .
and we &apos;re just trying to deal with the capacity that the pattern runs of capacity , can develop , by bringing electrochemical memories on the net .
there &apos;s happily now a lot of studies .
and at that purpose , people come along and look at our experience on the understanding of our insistance .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can take a piece of far future .
and many discussions that i had over the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years to the subject of photovoltaics .
it &apos;s not going , it &apos;s powerful , children , we &apos;ve calculated everything , never .
we &apos;ve got 30 gigawatt photovoltaics in germany .
that &apos;s productive .
and i just go out that we &apos;re going to have the same capacity on electrochemicals around the world .
it &apos;s easy , that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to come .
there will be such a whole bunch of resistances and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve experienced just over the last two years , that the scientists are putting on my side .
we have now getting over 10 million projects , also about ten megawatt battery right now to german web .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so from therefore you &apos;re also noticing that there &apos;s a change there , and only from that distriction to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent renewables are .
and if you have a hundred percent renewables , that &apos;s like an autack &apos;s system .
so far , in discussions are always trying to do these insulans , which are doing authark , they have their own little net , which has nothing to do with our connection .
and the question is quite easy , if they &apos;re completely independent from any fossil or uranium energy consumptions that are brought out somewhere in the world and brought into them , then they 
then they &apos;re just going to use what the sun and wind is there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision from a reasonable energy supply , and i &apos;m also gratef to cradle that they said , use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and informations come , also the talk from premium kola , that you &apos;re going to be a collective and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you in the sense that you can be quietly crazy , and you can also have a vision .
and you have to remain pretty much , but i think that &apos;s going on .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , when the streets went through the streets in los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african american , sympathically , room , homeless , who was only two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because steve &apos;s article became a book that &apos;s been moved again , with robert downey junior as a steve lopez anthony aers , the contrast that stud
nathaniel left julilaria , suffered a nerve collapse and 30 years later , he lived as homelessers on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend to read them all steven &apos;s book or looking at the movie , so you can &apos;t understand the wonderful connection that &apos;s between these two men , but how it allowed the music to
i met my ager in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney concert hall .
he &apos;d just heard a demonstration of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth , and came behind the stage to imagine it .
he talked about in a very harder and social sound over yo-yo and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never create in the baseball series , and that &apos;s all because of the tucky passage of 
we came up with music , and a couple of days later , i got an email , which stood that nathaniel is interested in me .
i mean , i have to mention that nathanell rejected a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric shocks and with theorazine and hands through , a trauma that has followed his en
and as a consequence , he &apos;s particularly profound for these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of skid row , always goes around the st
and in the same way , nathaniel , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in the warld disney concert hall , and he had this iron flacker in his eyes and worked .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how somebody wanted to poison in sleep .
i was afraid , not mine , but i fear that i could lose him , and that i could destroy his relationship to the times when i started talking about transmitters and advergious and other exciting forms 
so i started playing .
i played the first set of beethoven &apos;s violincorter .
and while i was playing , i realized that in nathanies &apos;s eyes went a complete change .
it was as if he stood under the influence of an invisible drug , a chemical response that catalytor was my game .
nathaniel &apos;s manic larner transformed in understanding , into a quiet curiosity and power .
and as through a miracle , he took his kinds and started playing a couple of clips of violin concerts , and then asked me to end them -- the mindle son , trahikovski , sibelium .
we then started talking about music , started by back over beethoven , brahn , braunders and all the other gs , from bartoo to sasa pekka salones .
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopedian knowledge about music , but it was also a close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i only know my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
by playing music , and music talked about music , was from this paranoid , confused man who was moved through the streets of los angeles , a lovely , educated , excellent musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means seal health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something .
and that &apos;s how he engages his policient states .
i understood that that &apos;s exactly the creature of the art .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing music : so we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s in all of us , deep inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens through our creativity of reality .
and the reality of that expression accomplishes all of us , and moves , inspired and unites us .
what nathaniel went , so it brought him back into a community of friends .
the providing force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who realized his talent and looked at him .
and i &apos;m going to mush music with nathaniel , whether in the warld disney concert hall , or skid row , because it reminds me of why i &apos;ve become musicians .
thank you .
bruno gissani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupt : i &apos;d like to play something that i &apos;ve unclearly stolen the cellisten .
i hope you &apos;re making me .
so i know many fishes in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , wonderfully , good consistency , salary , a best steller in the mining map .
what a fish .
even better , it was broken in aquaculture after the sustainability of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling him .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
and one day , the head of company called and asked if i could talk at an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs , how do we keep fishing on our mines ?
over the last 50 years , we fished the oceans as we have beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to overcome the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tunas , the helicoptures , the laugh , sword fish , they &apos;re broken .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so probably , or evillabulture , fishing , will be part of our future .
many arguments about it . fishing statements pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a great disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a food restoration of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of wildfish are needed so you get a pound of tuna .
not very sustainable .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to support them .
and the day before the event , i called the head of public work for the company .
let &apos;s call him done .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t pollute the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish distributes , not focused . &quot;
and then he asked , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
this food restruction of 2.5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what do you feel ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , short before the event , done .
i said , &quot; don , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i &apos;m telephone with some people in the company , nobody could give me a pretty answer , until i finally telephone telephone .
let &apos;s call him done .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algaes and some fisheries , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone and bone , dry and processed and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of perhaps two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chickens of fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i entered myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-esseed engineer and good person .
i &apos;m actually .
no , i &apos;ve actually moved out of this fish , because , i &apos;m swearing at god , tasted the fish after this entertainment for chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , where you get better you learn your fish , you love the fish the more .
i &apos;ve eaten him first in a restaurant in south spain .
one friend journalist had spoken for a long time from this fish .
it &apos;s been doubled us in a sense .
he came on the table with a bright , almost blaming white color .
the chef had considered him .
take twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste a fish so well after he &apos;s been connected ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it miguel . it &apos;s actually michule .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way you understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta lama .
this is a fishing up in the southwestern corner spain .
it &apos;s near the flow of the gualdivique .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
they were growing fleshers on what were basically wetlands .
they did that by determining the country .
they built this complicated result of channels , and they put water from the country , and they put out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that that wouldn &apos;t work , not economic .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country in 1982 .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve reversed the flow of the water .
they &apos;ve literally surrounded the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to pull the water again .
they flooded the channels .
they created a 11,000 hectare -- barsh , the mean , shrinler , al -- and his company has completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare out in the horizon that &apos;s one million miles away , and everything you see are flooded channels and this density , rapid march .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part , &quot; a crocodile to the kisses . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fighted us through the wetlands and i watch and sweats , has mate to my knees , and miguel holds a biological lecture .
here &apos;s a rare glidar .
now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here he sees a pattern of conditions that reminds him to the tanzanian giraffes .
it turns out that might has spent most of his career in the michu of national park in africa .
i asked him how he &apos;s become a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes , and it goes into more species of rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the biotical community of ipprogress , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head has been weak about this connected piece of delicious fish that i had on the outside .
so i interrupted him . i said , &quot; miguul , how does your fish taste so well ? &quot;
he showed on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eats your fish ?
what &apos;s the food reservation ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-representative .
there &apos;s no food .
ever beyond a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later on the day , i went around with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; unlike every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
at the moment , it was as if there was a filmmaker of a stage change .
and we bowed around the corner , and we &apos;re uoing the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos , literally pinker goes so far .
&quot; that &apos;s success . &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your book , pink .
they &apos;re going . &quot;
buds ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; migue , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing into the birds .
well last year , on this piece of 600,000 birds were , more than 250 different ways .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in all of europe .
i said , &quot; migue , is a great direct bird was not the last thing you want to have on a fishing ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building extremely , not intense .
this is an ecological network .
the flaminos are eating the shrimps .
the shrimps eat the physoplankton .
so the pinkers better the belly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about it . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators .
fishing , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and , by the way , these flaminos of the presentation shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away , where the ground thing is better for the nest mating .
every morning , they fly 200 miles to the farm .
and every night , they fly 200 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the striked white line of the land streets .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , do you fly 200 miles to the farm , and then fly 200 miles back in the night ?
do that for children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i &apos;ve just quoted a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this bunch , cheated taste .
i &apos;m almost never going to cook at that .
and yet , when i tried them in south spain , she didn &apos;t taste at all for fishing .
it tasted sweet and in , as if you would take a bite of the ocean .
i mentioned this to migue and he did not .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a swim .
it &apos;s the last disease before something &apos;s going on in the body .
she &apos;s developed in the course of evolution to sustain incidences . &quot;
and then he asked , &quot; but our water has no incentives . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures your success at the success of their predators .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have incredients , it &apos;s enormous , because the water that flows through this farm , comes from the flow of gualaqiquir .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that rivers today tend to lead them , to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow of pollution .
and when it &apos;s fighting through the system , and that leaves the water than they come in .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a water review , and not just t
because when the water flows out , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take him , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as romantic , is also increasing .
you might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good foods whether we &apos;re talking about barch or meat .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one in which food actually tastes .
but for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not realists , we &apos;re engineers . we &apos;re lovers .
we love weeks . we love little family supplies . we &apos;re talking about regional foods . we &apos;re eating bio .
and if you claim that that &apos;s the things that the future of good foods are insuranced someone and says , &quot; hey people , i love pink flaminos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
one billion people are going to hunger today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than than ever -- because of crasses of inequalities in distribution , not the total production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because she has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grains of plant fresers , pesting forces of monocultures , chemicals on fish , chickens of fish , and all the time has asked the agribusiness , &quot; if we feed more people , &quot; if we feed
that was the movement . it was the justice . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a commercial in development , a tissue that encourages that fast ecological capital that enables this production .
it &apos;s not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our grandmother is threatened today , not because of engaging resources , but because of general resources .
it &apos;s not through the latest power and tractor inventions , but through fertile country , not by pumping , but through fresh water , not by chains , but through forests , not by fishing boats a
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are able to feed themselves ?
to do that , they don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are standing up in it , and it never produced something really good for the food .
let &apos;s start looking at the ecological model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going back to two billion years of work experience .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
operations that are not only operations that are instead of using , operations that are extensive instead of only intense , farmers who are not just generators , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook than i ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because when the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i &apos;d like to engage you a thing today is that the entire of the data that we consume , is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information transmission , i want
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a typical death graph at age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivo , and what i can do with pito is that i can filter after a particular death , we say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes .
and that &apos;s because in the middle age here , the people are most active , and they &apos;re over here at the most comfortable .
we can go out one step further , and then you see the data then new and see that circular diseases and cancers are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
so when we go on and sort after age , we &apos;re saying 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are actually the main cause of what people should worry about .
and who &apos;s continuing to research that this is particularly true of men .
so you can see that this is looking at information and data in this way , reminds very significant information graphics in this way .
and if we can make this for raw data , why not even for content itself ?
so what we have here are the covers of every single &quot; sports illustrate , &quot; which were ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it after my talk in their rooms .
with pivot , they can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular experience .
so when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this spending and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click over here , which is where all of me spending in which lance armstrong mentioned .
now , if i wanted to get a grain overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the issue of driving ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going back a step back and extend the perspective .
now i &apos;m going to see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that when you look at this kind of information , targets , widers , zoom , zoom , you &apos;re not looking , you &apos;re not looking for you , you &apos;re not just looking f
you make something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i &apos;d like to continue to do this idea with about what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia and reduce it to a little summary .
the summary contains a short surgery and a symbol for the area of it comes from .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the popular wikipedia .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are the popular on wikipedia .
so i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after choicing the government , i realize that the wikipedia actories that are most of the time magazines , &quot; people &apos;s people . &quot;
this is really important , because this is an insight that isn &apos;t in a single wikipedia .
it &apos;s just to recognize when you go back and look at the whole .
looking at a certain of these summaries , i can go to the theme of time magazines , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see all together .
now , when i look at all of these people , i realize that the majority of the governments are governments . some of them come from science , some of them come from the economy . some of them come fr
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you can see , we &apos;re surfing on the web , the first time it &apos;s really a web , not just by side , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you something else , which might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pipo , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really no browser , but you can look at the websites to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step , and i can jump directly to a specific section .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because it &apos;s only by looking at websites in this way of looking at the whole internet to look at the same way .
so i can zoom into a certain time in a certain time .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve believed in here .
and i can sort of see everything i &apos;ve been looking back for today .
and , when i go back out a step out and look at everything , i can rearrange my course after my search past . here , i &apos;ve been looking for &quot; nepotic & &quot; here to live lab pivot .
and from here , i can go into the site and call it back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s been used again , and every time it makes the entire picture of greater than the sum of the data parts .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a flow .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on your head , so we &apos;re instead of going from one to the other , start to go from many things to many things , and that &apos;s what p
if we can do that , that &apos;s going to be a new source of detail , perhaps a new source of meaningful information .
and , instead of moving only in information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we experience knowledge , then maybe we can actually pull wisdoms from that .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m hearing , thank you very much .
i grew up with a major portion of science fiction .
i was driving an hour with the bus to school , every day , an hour every day .
and my nose always put in a book , a science-fiction book , which my thoughts did in other worlds , and in a narrative way , my deep in me in me , sitting , insurgent curiosity .
this curiosity showed that if i wasn &apos;t in the school through the forests , and the forests were collected , and samples and beetles and bugs and bags , and looked at home under the microscope 
i was completely excited , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and release the limitations of the possible .
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew the moon and explore the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and a world full of miracles that we could never imagine before .
and that &apos;s probably good at this science fiction role .
and i was artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there was neither video games even this oversation with computer-generated movies all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to everybody . if we read a book at the time , we took the description of the author and projected them on the canvas in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and painting from alien , extrate worlds , robots , robots , shapes and all this .
in the math class , i became all the time on the teacher , like , i hidden behind textbook , hidden around .
the creativity had to somehow spend out .
and what happened is something interesting , which was fascinated by jacques cousteau &apos;s shows , the thought of one of us was completely unknown world here on our earth .
certainly i &apos;d never reach an alien world with a spacecraft . that seemed to me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic like all of the things that i &apos;d always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to become diver .
the only problem was that i was living in a little village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t really encourage myself .
i took my father until he finally made a dive school in buffalo , new york , finally , exactly on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my diversity in a pool of the ymma in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , i got a real ocean , i got two years later , when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , which have been standing , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under water ; 500 hours of this in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flather oceans , so rich in fascinating lives , how we can really imagine it .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , really , contrast to our own , common imagination .
until today &apos;s day , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love of the ocean holds up with the same intensity as eight and ever .
when i looked at adults as an adult , it was the filmmake .
this seemed to be the best possibility of telling stories to tell stories to create images .
as a child , i drew computing books and so .
and so films were the way to put images and stories , and that &apos;s what they were together .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , from the science fiction location : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abjss . &quot;
in &quot; abys &quot; i could connect my preference for the underwater and diving with the filmmaking .
and so my two passions were going to integrate .
something interesting happened in &quot; abjss , &quot; in order to solve a storytelling problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we went to computer generated
what came out of that was the first computer-generated soft surface figure that was ever in a movie .
and the film didn &apos;t take money , exactly he played his production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like hypnotized by the magic that went out of i
arthur clarke &apos;s law , are known advanced technology and magic anymore .
so they saw a little magic .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that needs to be involved into the film . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator , &quot; my next film , much more .
together with ilme , we &apos;re creating the guy of liquid metal , and the success was going to get out of how this effect would get .
and it worked . again , we had created something magic . and the effect in the audiences was the same thing , but we &apos;ve been playing a little more money with the movie .
from these two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for milms .
so i started a company with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of the best make-up and creature designers . she was called &quot; digital domain . &quot;
and the basic idea of this company was to overcome the phase analog processes with optical printers , etc . and they &apos;re starting to start with digital productions .
that &apos;s what we did , and then we got a competitive advantage .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creature and character design -- which we actually founded the company , too slowly .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was writing the message of visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new height , with realistic human , expressive characters
but the measure pressed very beautifully , and people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to create that .
so i shifted this and did this other film about the great ship that &apos;s going on .
the film studio i have sold this as &quot; romem and julia on a ship , &quot; and it became a love film of epis scale , a passionate movie .
but what i really wanted to do is to do the real way of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
and i convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re diving to the wake . we &apos;re filming the real truck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
that &apos;s incredibly important . it &apos;s a good one for marketing . &quot;
and i came up with them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy , but that goes back to that that your imagination can make a reality .
we then actually created six months later , a reality where i related in a russian diversity , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a bu
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that &apos;s really watching me .
and the preparation was enormous . we needed to build cameras and lights and all sorts of things .
and i fell how much these deep sea changes were looking at a space mission .
well , they were also high-engineering and recent planning .
you get into this capsule , then you switch into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope of rescue if you don &apos;t create it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction film .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , the part that has to do with curiosity and science , and it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermall , and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , and for the scien
so that &apos;s the right thing , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met something unusual decision .
and after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to lay my main profession as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice and becomes full-time researchers . &quot;
and then we started , we went to the bismarck , and they explored with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the titanic .
we took little robots that we &apos;d built , which were developing a fiberglass cable .
our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship that had never been done before .
nobody had explored the inside of the wrack , you didn &apos;t have any means . so we developed the technology .
well , and so i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a dive boat , and see planks that are pretty similar to these boards here and that i know that once has played there .
and i fly with a little robotic vehicle through the walks of the ship .
i &apos;m actually doing it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the titanic wrock .
this was the most surrealest form of a djx that i &apos;ve ever experienced because before i went around a corner , i always knew what would happen in the vehicle of the vehicle because i was walkin
and that was an exact copy of the blueprint of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made me this telepresence experience that you &apos;re using such robotic avatars , and you could use their own consciousness into the vehicle , into this other shape of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and perhaps a small look at what might happen in a couple of decades when you have cyborg bodies to explore something or other things , in all post-humans &apos;s futures , which i can imagine mysel
and after these expeditions , we started what we &apos;ve seen down there , really estimate , for example , these deep sexuals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s just
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in one sunlight based system as we do .
and that &apos;s what you see animals that directly next to a 500 degrees cellusion means that they can survive .
and at the same time , i &apos;ve been very interested in space science , which was back to the science-fiction influence from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who &apos;re interested in space and having them with nasa and sit in the nasa &apos;s supplies , and planning to russia , then fly through russia , then fly throug
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was going out that i took space scientists with us into the deep sea .
and i took them up with and showed them access to the world : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources to look arou
we turned documentary films , but actually , science , the space science is .
so the circle between my existence as a science-fiction fan , when as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of this discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly now think of a director also has to be a leader like a ship captain or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i did these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;ve just playing the production cost . from free doesn &apos;t take .
all of you think i &apos;m between titanic and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have run the nails on a beach on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
not a fram , no money . what do you do ?
you make it around the job , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that &apos;s going on . you &apos;re going to do it because of the strange connection that &apos;s eme
because we &apos;ve only made all of these with only 10 to 12 people who have worked up together in years , sometimes we were two to three months to each other .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve made a task that you can &apos;t explain .
when you go back to land , and says , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound , and the whole thing about , all the technology , and the trouble , the human performance , when you work o
there &apos;s a connection , an each other respect .
so when i got back to turn my next movie &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re respecting your team and deserves in the course of that respect .
so the dynamics was really changed .
so there i stood again with a little team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that we didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
it &apos;s an incredible challenge .
and we &apos;ve become a real family for a four-and a half years .
and it changed my way to make films , completely .
there were people who thought we were really good at these oceans and transported pandora to the planet .
for me , it was more principle ways to do my job , the actual process that changed in the result .
so what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think the first place is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the direction of your team is more important than all the lobers in the world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a guess how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t get yourself .
that &apos;s another one for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , not against themselves , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and in explorition , you have to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a trust .
not an important thing that required innovation , ever been done without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks like this .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
i &apos;m talking to you today about energy and climate .
and that might surprise something because my full-time attention at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , to allow the things that we have to invent and deliver the poorest two billion
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than for each other on the planet .
climate description means that their seeds are not growing over many years ; it &apos;s too much or little rains , and things are going to change how their fragile environment can &apos;t hold .
this leads to hundred , it leads to uncertainty . it leads to close .
so , it &apos;s going to be a climate change terrible for them .
also , the energy price is very important .
in fact , if they could only reduce the price , the process would be energy at the most effective thing .
well , the energy price is like over time .
in fact , progress society is based on energy progress .
the coal revolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the electricity prize , and therefore we have refrigerators , conditioning , we can ma
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s half the price -- we &apos;re making a new barrier , and these barriers depend with co2 .
carbon warms the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re summing the emergenc co2 that leads to temperature and this temperature has some very negative follows . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indirect consequences that the n
now , the exact relationship between a co2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some uncredities , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certain unclearity about how bad these follows are going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists , &quot; do we really need to get down at zero ?
not half or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying we &apos;ve got a three-and-a-half high truck , which has to happen under a three bridge , and then you can stand underneath that .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we have a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to produce changes that are down to zero .
it &apos;s been constant .
only different economic changes have affected it at all , and we need to go from rapid rise to reduction and a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . you &apos;ve got a little bit multiplication . they have this thing -- co2 -- that you want to get towards zero , the average energy for every service and the co2 th
so let &apos;s look at every factor and think about how we get this in zero .
probably one of these numbers have to get very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
first , we have the population .
today live 6.8 billion people .
and it &apos;s writing to 9illion dollars that move to nine billion .
when we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproduction medicine , we could reduce that at 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we see an increase in 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this includes everything , the food that we eat , clothes , television , heat .
these are very good things and poverty reduction to make these services almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make a distribution and use less , but on average , that number is going up every year , and then more than doubling , the number of serv
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . do you see home light so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school work under the street light .
well , in effectivity , where , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t get up .
because of different successes in the light sector , through new methods , through new methods , there are a lot of services that are energy individuals , there are some single services whose energy
in other services , like manufacturing fertilizers , 105 , 15 , 55 : 50 : 50 : 50,000 or the air traffic , is a lot smaller for improvements .
totally , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction around a factor three or maybe even a factor 3 .
but with the first three factors , we &apos;re 26 billion perhaps the very best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to embate per energy .
it turns out the question , whether you can get this to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
when you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity is co2 , except the renewables and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonder .
now if i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
normally , there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
normally , you &apos;re just like that , and some come , others .
but in this case , we have to give pollution and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really bring that ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that &apos;s going on here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitoes , and somehow people liked this .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
for energy , that &apos;s what he did .
i decided that this was going to be likely to be my this year &apos;s fireflies to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you assure you that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they don &apos;t even get to leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all sorts of play solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t do much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have an imaginable scaling and imaginability of imaginative , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see fiv
i &apos;ve got times , geodess , fusion and biofuels .
these are maybe a modern contribution , and when they &apos;re expecting better than i expect , but my reason here is that we have to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give us any of them 
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , combustion of coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is perhaps seems simple , but that &apos;s not . you have to come up with all the co2 that comes from the chimney that comes from the chimney that comes from the chimney , and th
there are some pilot projects that create this on a 60 percent , 80 percent , but getting it to 100 percent , and an engineering for the carbon is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is t
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times bigger than any kind of garbage you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volumes .
so that &apos;s a hard one .
next , nuclear energy .
it has also three big problems . the cost , especially in high-regulated countries are high . the question for security is that you really feel that there &apos;s nothing to go wrong , despite human
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that are perhaps soluble , and where you should be working on .
the last three of the five has put together .
these are the renewables as they &apos;re called .
and they also have -- even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is the energy density that these technologies create lower than the power stations .
these are energy farms , you talk about a lot of square kilometers , thousands of times more area than a normal power plant .
also , these sources come into interruption .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , she doesn &apos;t seem every day , and the same wind is not constantly .
that &apos;s why you have to depend on these sources , a way that energy is available in times if it &apos;s not available in times .
so there are great price challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , you also need 
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made , look at the cars , computers , cell phones , pockets , which uses the world , and i found that all batteries that w
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 better than the approach to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources about saying 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to support 100 percent on that , you need an incredible minder battery .
well , where should we go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project , &quot; how are we going to come to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
for many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there &apos;s a lot of things that are already engaged .
bill gross has several companies , under other things that has great solar technologies .
vindo kosla invested in dozens of companies that make great things and have interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , follows the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear world ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry again a few times ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terrapower concept means you &apos;re instead of one part of the uran , the one percent , the 2325 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , that 1228 .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this , but you could never reasonably simulate if it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that yeah
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost profile is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors today .
instead of breaking your head , burn it easy . it &apos;s a great thing .
the uranium is going to use gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column as the &quot; moving wave of reactor . &quot;
it really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called uranium .
the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re just filtering , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our design look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the intersection .
a lot of talks about an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be created in poor countries , and still a little agriculture , hopefully , walking and cement will be clean up to them .
so , in order to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , their electricity generation has to completely create their electricity generation .
the other note says whether we use the zero emissions technology whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff .
when we go back from there , how should it look like the 2020s ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the efficiency to bring reduction , and the less we emitate , the less we emitate , the co2 sum is going to be the carbon and the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we don &apos;t lead to the great reductions , only same , or even a little bit more important as the other things that are the speed of innovation for th
these breakthroughs , we have to track with full polls , and we can measure that : in company , in pilot projects and regulation changes .
there are many great books to this subject .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice , and david mckays &apos;s &quot; sustainable energy withouth the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through it , and they create a framework where this can be discussed because we need to support from all sides .
there &apos;s some things that needs to come together .
this is a wish .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you just had a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , half-based energy price without co2 invented
this has the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long-term and short-term terms are terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of these tw
so what do we need to do ?
and for what kind of things i &apos;m going to do ?
we need to use for more research money .
if countries meet in places like coppensations , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk to this innovation strategy , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , carbon incentives , cap &amp; amp ; dream something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to lead dialogues rational and more complete , and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can feel it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much better to understand something better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists that we did , we just need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make 
the hard step is the building of the first reactor to find other billions , the regularias and the place that actually builds the first of them .
once the first thing is , if the first thing is promised , it &apos;s all clear because the economic , the energy density is so different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to really understand that , which means almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuels , this used uranium , and then the process begins and works down ?
bg : exactly . today you need to research the reactor , so there are a lot of people , and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and brings things inside , that &apos;
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can feel it for 60 years -- think about a column -- that you bury without the entire complexities .
and it sits there and burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished .
a nuclear reactor that offers a solution to the garbage .
bg : yeah . now , what &apos;s happening to the garbage : you can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- take it into the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start by taking the trash that exists that &apos;s in these curves or dry containers in the reactors , and that &apos;s our good fuel .
so what &apos;s a problem for these reactors what we &apos;re in our fills , and that will dramatically reduce dramatically during that process .
but while they &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these opportunities .
where &apos;s the biggest interest to do so what ?
bg : now we haven &apos;t determined us in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting regulations for everything the number &apos;s &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interests 
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese made something in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built them , so everybody who &apos;s got a fast reactor , a candidate for our first .
in your imagination : time frame and probability to call something like this ?
bg : well , we need one of these scalable , power-generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then 20 years .
this is like the deadline , which has shown us the environmental models that we need to continue .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything is going on , and that &apos;s a big wish , that could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , who , exactly , when their approaches work , the fortune works for their pilots .
and it would be best when it creates multiples , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
among the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
that would have been it without the environmental challenge , but that &apos;s so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know what their work is not as good as these , but there &apos;s the modular way , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactortype , which seems something difficult , but maybe tell that about us .
and so there are different things , but the beautiful thing is that an uran molecule has a million times as much energy like it , we say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the 
if that doesn &apos;t work what ?
we need to introduce emergency statements to try to keep the earth &apos;s perature stable ?
bg : when you get to this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve eaten too much , and it &apos;s short of a heart attack , what do you do ? you may need a heart peration or similar .
there &apos;s a research direction called geoengineering called geoengineering to deliver the warming so that we would get 20 or 30 years to build us together .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working on the insurance because you may not make you because you &apos;re further , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart curation .
i don &apos;t know if you lead the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discuss in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things come faster , if things come faster ,
climate skippers : do you have one or two sentences for you maybe to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that shift with the clouds that shift things ?
there are very , very few things that you can say at all , of which there is an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is similar as aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay that much later .
and that &apos;s why the idea , now , if you have all kinds of pressing problems , to invest in something that you have later -- and the investment isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and t
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos
and that would be your answer to the born lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals are doing waste of malaria , and money to invest in
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year than they do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
underneath things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you get too much money , and here you can disagree with sensible people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to finance that , and for me , most of the waste is happening .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short from a cost , and funds only the learning curve . i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be a lot more cheaper .
if the abstract that you get , it &apos;s a very high energy prize , then you can only continue .
i mean , each of us could spend five times as much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new machine is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research don &apos;t talk anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still associated because of his earlier stories , associated with the skeptic camp , but he understood that that &apos;s a very lonely group , and that &apos;s why he brings the research 
and that &apos;s a thought that i think for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that &apos;s going to support .
bill , i think it &apos;s almost all people here when i say , i really hope that your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman put a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is quite easy . four teams have to be the largest possible structure with 20 spaghetti , about 20 spaghetti , and build a marshmalow .
the marshmallow must be on the top .
and even though it seems to be really easy , it &apos;s actually really hard because it &apos;s people to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i did about 70 workshops around the world , with students and architects , even with cots of fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something on this task , which enables deep impress
normally , most people start to operate themselves about the task .
they &apos;re talking about how it &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re running .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they &apos;re sicking and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re investing a lot of their time constantly growing structures .
and then finally , before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they put it down to the top , and they step back and &quot; ta da &quot; ! admire their work .
but what then , almost always happened that the &quot; ta da &quot; becomes an &quot; ul-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow does , that the white of the marshmallow does , that the wh
there are a series of people who have much more &quot; ul-oh ok &quot; moments than others , and underneath the worst are fresh web absolutes .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and producing really quiet shapes .
and of course there are teams that have much more &quot; ta da &quot; shapes , and under the best are fresh fresh from kindergarten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter , they &apos;re not only producing the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might wonder is : how does this come ? why ? what about them ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the children investing time to be the spaghetti gmbb . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that blu students have been trained to find a real plan , ok ?
and then realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kindergarten children are different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , that they have multiple proto
constructures recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of an ideative process .
and with each attempt , the children get immediately feedback , which works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , essentially -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of them is at about 80ch , blow students create half of them , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
it &apos;s the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-enhancing geometric patterns are the keys to build stable structures .
ceos are something about average , but here &apos;s interesting here .
you put an exceltive administrator on the team , you &apos;ll significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . they look around and recognize &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict the prediction . why is that ?
because they have specific skills of process .
they lead the process , they understand .
and that team that regulates and on the work , the performance of the team is significantly improving .
specialized skills and process and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that have typical , they get about six , the stable structures .
i tried something exciting .
and i thought , we &apos;re going to get the poker approach .
so i did a thousand percent prizes in software for the winners .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a structure of structure .
if somebody &apos;s been building a two-fiect high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competitions have a strong effect o
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what does it happen now ?
now , they understood the advantage of prototyping .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been from the same , bad team one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
there are profound lessons for us about nature of drive and success .
you may ask , why would someone actually invest in a marshmallow challenge to create a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams to help cars , video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge is , it helps them identify hidden assumptions .
because open , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , to build basic language , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who &apos;re interested in can visit marshmallow hallengeg.
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a step for step there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world how people optimize and refine .
there &apos;s also world record .
and the basal lesson , i think , the construction is actually a connective sport .
it demands that we all put our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , how our feelings and our doings , in the challenge that &apos;s before us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything it takes to bring us from an &quot; ul-oh oh &quot; -- to bring it to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s have a machine here .
it &apos;s a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go to the past , they can go to the future ; they can &apos;t stay in there and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to back in time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;ve done down to nostalgia , you know , thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurer .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time there were ever on this planet , no matter which scale they exist : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , disease rates .
there was never been a time like this .
my great grandparents died when they were 60 .
my grandparents put this number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the features .
so there &apos;s better a nine at the beginning of my death .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid who &apos;s born in new delhi today can expect to live like the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever did .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re disappeared .
we &apos;ve forced them . holf .
in the rich world , the diseases that millions of us have still threatened by one generation , hardly .
dippetries , rotes , child paralysis ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific way of trying things see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were mentioned .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world walk hungry to bed every day .
this number is going up , and it &apos;s going very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and it &apos;s not just that , we have used our imagination to destroy this world .
drinking , foreign country , rainforests , oil gas , they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we also disappear .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country they live .
i think we can provide this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a wish .
but this stops me night -- one of the things that hold me at night -- we never needed scientific advances like now , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to use it reasonable as we can today .
we &apos;re on the threshold to astonishing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really need to go back hundreds of 300 years ago to find a time where we have progress in which we have progres
people hell in their beliefs , and that &apos;s so close that you can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth , it &apos;s going to liberate .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a right to his opinion to progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have any right to their own facts . &quot; sorry , they didn &apos;t .
and i needed a while to find out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for &quot; the new yorkers , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to get resistance , resistance to what at the end , is the most effective thing in the history of human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always did , i wrote an article and drove .
and soon i wrote an article about genetically changing foods .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were in a particular random that was an
but you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we &apos;re typing , we &apos;re enjoying , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles worried me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that didn &apos;t make me crazy at all .
these were current people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that brought me to each other ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we didn &apos;t have the same relationship to the progress , like earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about it , with little leaderships about it , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes into science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call some names and people are going to understand .
chernobyl , the challengers , vixox , mass destruction , the u.s. presidential elections .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and the problems with the people we believed that they were always right . be skeptical .
imagine asking them evidence , demand them .
don &apos;t take anything than given .
but now , if you get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can say that , that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of the fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story has been published , a terrible story that the autism epidemic with the master , mump , and they &apos;re going to connect .
very frightening .
bunch of the studies have been done to see if that &apos;s wrong .
bunch of studies should be done , that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all equal , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see to see what do we feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents from a government that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of that fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine is doing for masers .
that &apos;s scandally , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because somebody here has somebody here ?
does a single person in the audience are seeing somebody in masers ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
don &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world in the last year .
this is a lot of death through masers , 20 percent hour .
but because it &apos;s not happening here , we can draw it , and people like jenny mccrathy can walk around and messages from fear and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never are the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst mistakes of humanity .
no fear , no jellyfish , paddy , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it &apos;s called paul offite .
he &apos;s just developed a rotavurus vaccine with some other people .
he can save the lives of 400 , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , don &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul walks around and talks about vaccines , and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop to chammers .
and that &apos;s actually saying that .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul is talking about a public sustainable , he can &apos;t tell without armed guards .
he gets calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are incredible .
you take them out , the diseases go back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have now in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon children are going to die because that &apos;s just a question of the numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masers .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a commiliton of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little bit too school .
no one has told that ever before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against physical , no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in the lagos morning and flying to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands , and he gets a car , and it comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s infected with a paralyzisease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
that &apos;s the planet that we live in . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to get us in lies . we love that .
did you take all your vitamins today ?
echinacea , a little anti-oxidence that helps them on the line .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half the americans make that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cures , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly .
they &apos;re darking your urine . more they do almost never .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to completely agree .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i &apos;m understanding -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely cold and self-rising themselves to us who can afford it .
so we &apos;re walking away from that , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re walking in the poor of the placebo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , it &apos;s really a serious business because the stuff is mixed , and we &apos;ll give billions of dollars .
and i have all sorts of little repuisities here .
none of them -- gingko , wearing , echanaca , wheat , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s , but we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s concerned .
and you know what ? when i say that , people screw me and say , &quot; what cares you ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health minister who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my mammography experts , &quot; or some cancer jacquer that
if you get on that path where beliefs and magic and science , they get to a place where they want to be .
they got to the toabh mbei in south africa .
he brought 800,000 of his people because he instituted that red bees , bonal and nuclear one are much more effective than antiretrovirals that we know that they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country which is worse than any other one of that disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have . they always have .
well , the most brillist epidemic where we &apos;re in the first thing is this absording struggle between the workers genetically changed food and biolite .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every risk , every branch of petersie , every rose cool , was changed by the people .
you know , there were no mandarines in paradise .
there was no cantaloup melon .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them works , and some of them don &apos;t work .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more concerned , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re getting genetically changing food .
why do we do that ?
well , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want giant fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies patenting lives .
we don &apos;t want to companies own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this ?
yeah , you &apos;re right . repair this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent champ .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we fear is a real deal , and it keeps millions of people f
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shameling .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changing food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this stuff , like manios .
manioc is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s about like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mine .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists have all this just in it .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t stand , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panises , but it &apos;s beautiful .
and everything i can say about is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , well , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to go around genes ?
it &apos;s not about shifting genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our performers on greater food , better food , unique foods .
it &apos;s not about rice crispies , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t , if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to make things like this , we &apos;re going to do something guilty that we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s ugly , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly fun entertainment , you may want to say , &quot; do you will still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them there where we want to .
we need to lead these entertainments , and we need to think , but if we get into the time machine and go to the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have .
i know that we can , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m affected is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , it &apos;s because you look at it like me , as &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to b
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to her , is a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in p
a deception becomes something real because somebody perceives it .
so for us to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you an elementary , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick , which is at least since the 1950s in every magic book for children .
i &apos;ve learned him from cub scout magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain why .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my mind .
i &apos;m going back to my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve , or coming out , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no one &apos;s moving anything -- as long as i go back here , nothing can go into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is quite easy .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything &apos;s good , the knife is going to be through my physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so stuck at his place that i can shake it , without having the knife .
there &apos;s nothing that &apos;s going on in my little or coming out , no tricks . and you can study everything .
ta-ta ta-ta .
well , this is a trick that i often teach little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception if you look more carefully , even though it &apos;s a very easy trick 
probably many of you here in the room have this trick .
he &apos;s working for this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m going around my wrist to make sure that nothing is disappear or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding my wrist is that the real secret is the illusion .
because now , where i turn my hand out of them , so you see them from behind , this finger has moved from where he was , my show finger , just from where he was , into a position that he was .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who didn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the finger changes his position .
and now you could talk about why that &apos;s a deception , why you don &apos;t perceive that there are only three fingers , because the minds and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t
but that &apos;s actually not here now . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my shop who &apos;s now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , through this movement , that the fingers move back .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can take your friends and neighbors . thank you .
well , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago , or something , i read a study that was really dealing with me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
because it turns out , if you provide a placebo in a white pill in the shape of an aspira pill , that &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you give the shape where you give the placebo , for example , change into a smaller pill , and put this blue and put a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , even though none of them are any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that &apos;s really what made me fly .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not everything .
if you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than any shape .
a color capsule that &apos;s yellow and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
also , the dose is playing a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistic . i &apos;m sorry .
so the critical thing is , ...
... that also the doses are playing a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to go to the needle .
right ? it &apos;s an injection with an effective -- a few millitaries of an effective substance that you &apos;re injecting a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
this graph is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and nothing of it has any really pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s only our belief in which it &apos;s going to get a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look like .
we know from this study that you have to go to the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is a 18-foot long hundrel . it &apos;s very , very , very , and i &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damian &apos;s special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now , i &apos;m going to stand this needle in my skin and push through them , until she &apos;s going to spend out on the other side .
if you &apos;re overwhelmed -- if you drop this easy in power -- i did this a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some of the people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s whe woman &apos
so , i &apos;m proposing when they &apos;re going fast , look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first secret part here .
you can see it the same , but you can also look when you want .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little unit .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make it crazy ?
and now , just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at messer trick .
it &apos;s about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and through themselves the skin , just to know a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people behind say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see it right . &quot;
the people in the spacecraft now come in .
let me show you out of you .
that &apos;s really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re going everywhere , look away , look away .
people back in the back or the ones that the later sees to video , say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it would be real , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really would b
okay , let me just squeeze a little blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
normally i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there &apos;s no wonder .
but i think in this framework here and with the intention of making something real , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle inside there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to find a couple of times in the next day .
i hope you &apos;re enjoying it . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
i have some people to count the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave after about 40 , and there were much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of the interest in happiness under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitives that are almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly acting of these cognitive falls .
this is going for lain that thinks about your own happiness , and it &apos;s for scientists thinking about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just like everybody else .
the first of these falls is to admit to complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word , because we apply it too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could construct it , but in big , and that &apos;s something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view of wha
the second case is a confidence of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both together in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the concentration illusion , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about something that is affecting well-being without distorting its meaning .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive fall .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer session had after one of my lectures that reported a sing , and it was absolutely lovely music , and at the end
and then he asked , really quite emotional , which has ruined the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what was ruined was the memories to the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was left with a memory , the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he got to keep .
what that really says is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s an experience self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the experience that the physician -- you know when the doctor asks , &quot; do you know when i put them here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory self , and the memory self is that is counting and getting the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that tells the doctor by asking the question , &quot; how d
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or similar .
these are two very different units , the experience self and the memory self , and the two is confused is part of the confusion of happiness .
well , the memory self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it begins immediately .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;re going to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that are underlying a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their record .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more of them ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient beh clearly suffered more clearly , and his facility was longer , and every minute of pain that had patient had patient b and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how much these patients thought they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients had a much worse emergence on the reflection of the patient b.
the stories of the garmers were different , and because it &apos;s a very critical part of the story of how it ends .
and none of these stories is very useless or great -- but one of them is clearly ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the ones that was worse , where the pain was at the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their performance , and a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse than for as a for being remembered .
well , this is a direct conflict between the experience self and the memory self .
from the view of the experience self , was clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been made , and it works , you could actually extend the piece of patient about just shaking the soun
that &apos;s going to lead the patient suffers , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you make it for a few minutes that the experience itself is worse on it , and you &apos;ve done that the memory of the patient is a lot better of it , because now you &apos;ve given patient a
what does a story draw ?
and that &apos;s going for the stories that memory provides us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
which is what a story is recording , significant moments and ends .
ends are very , very important , and in this case , dominated the end .
well , the experience self lives his life continuously .
it has one moment of experience , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve calculated this -- you know , psychological present than about three seconds long . which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of t
most of them are completely ignored by the memory self .
and yet they somehow get the impression that they should count , what &apos;s our life is happening during these moments .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we are in the world .
and how we use them to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory itself for us .
so we have the memory self and the experience self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal with time .
from the view of the experience , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two week &apos;s going to be twice as good as the one-work .
that &apos;s not working at all for the memory self .
for the memory self , there &apos;s been better than the world &apos;s room better than the one-women &apos;s holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and that &apos;s time actually the critical variable that &apos;s different from an experience self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , the memory self makes more than remembering and stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes the decisions , because if you have a patient , which is that we had two reflections in two different surgeons and decides that the memory has less bad , and t
the experience self doesn &apos;t have voice in this choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experience .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future , we don &apos;t normally think of the experience .
we think about our future as a previous memories .
and basically , you can look at that as a tyranny of the memory self , and you can think about the memory self as one that doesn &apos;t need the experience self through experience that doesn &apos;
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we do this very often the case , which means we &apos;re going on in the service of the memory self .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we doing from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of the memory self .
and when i think about that , i think of an overication that we did a couple of years ago in antarctica , who was clearly the best faith i had ever had , and i think relatively often in relationship
and i &apos;ve probably from my memories of this three-week journey , i would say about 25 minutes over the last four years .
well , if ever opened the order with the 600 images , i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and they &apos;re highly a hour .
there seems to be a distinction .
well , i &apos;m going to be a little bit extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the top of memories , but even if they do more of it , there &apos;s a real question : why do we give mem
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the fall , all their pictures are connected , and you get an amnesia drug so that they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you were to choose another room , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self , and you have to think about how they choose this conflict , and if you think about time , you ge
why we &apos;re looking for the picture that we &apos;re looking at is a problem that puts us with a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the experience itself ?
and then you wonder , how happy are the moments in the lives of the experience self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re a pretty good idea of getting from the happiness of the experience even over time .
if you ask the happiness of the memory self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s how happy , the person is when this person is thinking about their lives .
very different terms .
everybody who doesn &apos;t distinguish the exploration of happiness , and i belong to a lot of researchers in the well-being , which studied the exploration of happiness , in this way .
the distinction between the happiness of self and the happiness of the memory self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separations .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the 
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the self &apos;s happiness .
and the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how satisfaction is somebody with your life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy it lives and reverse his life .
just to give you an impression of correlation , the correlation is about 5. .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you &apos;d know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s lived his life as an eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his experienced self .
so the correlation is low .
we know a little bit about what &apos;s happiness happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means being happy with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the fortune of the self , they will do very different things at the end .
the conclusion of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we shouldn &apos;t really imagine happiness as a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , quite short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier when they say , live in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , they think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , let &apos;s say , in the climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the experience self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the kind of thinking self that decides how happy people are .
well , because the thinking itself is responsible , you can do at the end -- some people could end up with california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who go to california in the hope of being happier .
well , your experience self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you an impression of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
well , when we telephoned a couple of weeks ago , they mentioned that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallul poll .
is this something that you can participate is because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome that we found in the gallup poll is a number that we didn &apos;t expect .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the experience self .
when we looked at how emotions vary with the income .
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , un
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappy , the poorer they will .
that &apos;s what we get absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money makes you experience happiness , but that lack of money you certainly managed to be misery , and we can measure this misery , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the memory self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve the more happiness you &apos;re .
that &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , all of the american existences , it &apos;s about life , freedom , which is going for happiness .
when people would take this feel seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there an opportunity that politicians , that the country would generally take a field like the serious and make it based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , she &apos;s happening right now , and it &apos;s happening in other countries .
people are about recognizing that they should think happiness when you think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to experience experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life rating , so we have to do this discussi
how to increase happiness very differently depending on how they think and whether they think about the memory self , or whether they think about the experience self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the commercial years .
in the united states , you get to measure the experience of the experience of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades , i think , be part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me that it &apos;s going to be , or at least the most interesting political debate to follow for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kanman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design computer games .
i &apos;ve developed online for 10 years . and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in the reality of how to save in online play .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including you all to spend more and greater and greater games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week with online .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for play . &quot;
maybe something too much time , if you think about how many problems we have in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that there was 21 billion hours at the player per week .
and that seems like that , maybe it &apos;s a little different , so i repeat it : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , i think we have to try to play games online fo
no , i &apos;m really serious .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i believe that games are so incredible for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil toleans .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play , so he &apos;s built a camera before the players .
this is one of the classical expressions playing .
if you &apos;re not player , you might be some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also dependent in solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;ll see some nuances here , who moved up , and the mouths are a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who stands on the edge of something called the epis sea .
oh , you know that . ok . prima . so we have some players here .
an epic sea is a result that &apos;s so positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when you achieve it , they &apos;re actually shocked that they &apos;re actually something like that . that &apos;s an epish .
this player is short from an epis .
and that &apos;s what we have to see from million faces of problem-solvers around the world , if we take the towns of the next century , the face of those who are standing on the edge of all the epi
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life when we meet difficult problems .
i call it as &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; face , and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yeah ? ok .
that &apos;s me , like me , &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better than in play than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in the reality .
and i don &apos;t mean not just less successful , even though that &apos;s heard of it .
we &apos;re getting more in players . i &apos;m good at relation to the motivation , something significant , inspired collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a player , i think that many of us are transformed into our best version , at any time and immediately helpful , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary it try after the f
and in the reality , when we feel failures , we feel different from ourselves , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel like we feel threatened , we might depress , frustrated or cynical .
these feelings have never played when we play games , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d.
why is it impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just reach everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to collaborative problem solves .
and i &apos;ve discovered some things that make the epic pieces of online in online worlds .
so first , when you get into one of these online games , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust them a world-saving mission , and
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to their current level in the game right ?
so they &apos;re going to do that .
they never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , so you have to strike . but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and turns them . there &apos;s always to do something important .
and there &apos;s collaborators .
where they also go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epish mission .
we didn &apos;t have that so easy in the real life , this feeling that a finger station is willing to stand employees .
there &apos;s this epic history , this inspirational story why we are and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; two strengths , &quot; or &quot; an intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the real life .
when i leave that stage , i didn &apos;t -- one percent speak , and two-crazy idea , 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of cooperation online like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying at any time on the edge of the epish view that we &apos;re going to spend our time in these players .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraft player have spent 3.33 million years to solve the virtual problems of acrebth .
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound everybody .
but to see in the context , 19.5 million years ago , our first primate ancestors started to go .
so the first primate is primate .
ok , so if we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend now with play , that just makes sense , when you think about time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out we &apos;re using all this time on play , actually changing what we are as humans .
we &apos;re developing to collaboratively thinking , really creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher by carnegie mellon university : the average young person today in a country with strong play culture spends 10,000 hour
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10,000 hours , the exact time that they spend in school , from the five grade to graduate the high school -- when you &apos;re never missing .
so we have a complete paralligation here , on the young people , which means being a good player , like everything they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; over fliers . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the study of any subject until the 21st , we &apos;re going to master in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever , how the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players are good for ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have human potential before .
so many people , we have in the world that spend at least one hour per day with online play .
these are our master players ; 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry develops consoles that save energy and work on mobile wates , rather than the broadband internet , players around the world , especially in india , particularly in india , china , 
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what it is to master .
here are the four things i found . first of all , urgency optimism .
ok , imagine that like extreme self-motivation .
undergratity optimism is demand to do something to do , and to believe that we have an elementary hope in success .
players believe always believe that an epis is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spider of dense social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investigations that show people more after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve been beating us .
and the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we &apos;re trusting that somebody spends with us that the rules are going to be that we have the same goal and remain the playing things .
and so that &apos;s allowed to play the growth of bonds , confidence and with each other .
as a consequence , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the average world of warcraft players are playing 22 hours a week as a part-time job .
the reason is that , if we play , we are actually happier to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that we &apos;re optimally working as a human being , if we do hard , major work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love to love to be part of the massions of planetary missions .
here &apos;s a background information to go back to the right . you know all the wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 , the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve come together more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other issue in every other wiki in the world .
they create an epis story .
they create an epic source of knowing about the world of warrica .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as an individual .
and the only problem is that you think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward castronova is a people scientist .
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not getting less than a mass emigration in virtual worlds and online playing environments . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says .
it &apos;s not like me ... i develop play , i &apos;m something that &apos;s transformative .
so he says that &apos;s actually meaning , because players can reach in online worlds than in real life .
they can take play stronger social connections than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s completely logical that players spend more time in the virtual world than spending more time in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from one event , which is 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cubes , from sheep kills . you know ?
before these fantastic game controllers , there was sheep .
and these were the first of people developed play .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how playing were invented .
according to herodotus , games , actually the cube games , invented lydia during a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of lydies decided to be a crazy idea .
people suffered . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube play and posted a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so interested in the cube , because games are so fascinating and with satisfying , happiness productivity , surrounded that they were forgotten that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survived this famine in 18 years by eating on a day , and the next player .
so , i think , let &apos;s set playing games today .
we &apos;re putting games to extract the suffering of the real world .
we put play in order to emerge everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re going to take us what we need from play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , the famine was not better after 18 years , so the king was decided to sit one last cube game .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a cube , and they were allowed to break into an epic adventure .
they left lydies and they were leaving for a new home . they &apos;ve just returned so many people back to survive , and they were looking for the rest after an area where they could do .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence shows that the extremers that found the roman empire , the same dna like the old lydies .
and so scientists came recently to the idea that herodots &apos; crazy story actually got .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooting , which took almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story might agree .
maybe they actually saved her people through play by flying in games for 18 years , and then had this intuition , and then they learned so much about what they have saved the whole civilization .
so that &apos;s what we can .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
this was the first strategy game in real time the world of warcraft series -- that was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of the cube , we played play for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epis game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion play hours a week .
we should come in with that half of us spend an hour per day with play until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;ll ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in playing ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done my work in the last few years in the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it presses how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then people encourage that imagination into the reality .
we &apos;re imagining epic pieces , and we give people the opportunities to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you just about three games that i designed to try and give people the epish effects in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online play where you have to overcome an oil space .
the oil spill is invented , but we have enough online content so that it &apos;s going to be realistic and they actually live their real life in real time that you live , and then you have to figure
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change your life , because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re out of the oil . &quot;
that &apos;s an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have learned the habits in the game .
and so we &apos;ve got a bigger goal for the next worldview , higher target than just oil .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
the starting point is the computation of a supercomputer that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global extinction system , &quot; of course .
the call for players to sign up , we &apos;ve designed almost like a jerry brucket . &quot; film .
you know jerry brucketries movies where there &apos;s the dream team , and they have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-strifing and only together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just people , say , everybody is in the dream team , and it &apos;s our task to create the future for energy , food , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read if they google &quot; superstructure . &quot;
and the last game we get out on the 3. march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
and when you finish the game , they get the world bank , the relationship &quot; social recovery , &quot; by 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities all over sub-saharan africa and stop them to learn social reforming .
we have a comic . we have &quot; levels &quot; for regional understanding , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people , everywhere in the world , especially in developmental areas that are benefiting from imagining their own social enterprises to
i &apos;m going to come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we didn &apos;t have the real world .
well , i hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these entire superforces , happiness productivity , the ability to create lots of social nets , urgency optimism and desire to epice meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing games together to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me .
when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create every future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let the world-changing games start !
thank you .
and i &apos;d like to tell you something that was ready for a few months ago at writing an italian article .
i &apos;ve always written my synonymous dictionary , but i was done with the process of the text , and i fell that i &apos;ve never looked at my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; means &quot
i read them the contribution .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjective , &quot; helpless , useless , destroyed , destroyed , wounded , wounded , wounded , counted , countered , countering , countered , useless and weak .
antonymous : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read that list of a friend , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i couldn &apos;t talk anymore , and i couldn &apos;t talk anymore , and i couldn &apos;t collect myself after this o
of course , this was a freezed , old synnomy dictionary , and i just thought that the commission has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when i was starting with elementary school and started building myself outside of my family environment and form , also in terms of other childr
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use synonymous dictionary at the time .
and i would take this position seriously i would be born into a world that somebody like me perceives as a person whose lives can &apos;t have positively positive , but today i &apos;m going to cele
so i immediately called up the online expension of 2009 , and expected to find a more expensive contribution here .
here &apos;s the actualized version of that entry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; near antonyms &quot; is &quot; healthy and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
lots of ancient societies , including the greeks and the room , they really believed that the exception of a fluff has a great force , because what you &apos;re talking about is also manifest .
so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled people or a powerful people ?
just about to call a human being eightly as a child , could enough to restrict them and transmit them imagination .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open them doors ?
a person who opened doors for me was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington in delaare .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzillo . an italo american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t talk about correctly , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. would always fly very college and was just created for work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- up to my physiotherapy .
i had to repeat individual practices with these thickness , elastic transdors -- that &apos;s what they know to build my leg muscles , and i hated these things more than anything else . i hated them
and imagine i &apos;ve actually negotiated a five-year-old kid with dr. p. , and so trying to stop this exercise , of course , without success .
and one day he watched me at one of my practices -- these practices were just tiring and gloss -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you 
and when you get it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. so i do the practices that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the view that the five-year-old girls are in the disease in the second stock , but 
and i wonder today , how much his vision from me as strong and powerful young girls could imagine my self-image and i imagined to see me as one of nature from strong , powerful and atlethic human .
it &apos;s just one example of many , like adults in power positions , the imagination of a child can provide the imagination .
but as the examples have already quoted examples from the synonony dictionaries , our language provides no space to imagine what we all would like to do -- enable every single person to see themselv
our language comes back to the social changes that have been caught in many cases through a technology transformation .
and of course , from the medical standpoint , of course , say that my legs , the laser surgery for visualizations , knees from titan and artificial jumps for aging bodies that have people to define 
so perhaps this technological change is clearly because ever , there was another truth , which is that every human society can give something very special and very powerful and that the human abilit
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how i deal with curiosity and i &apos;m going to give you something that has never
this sentence from the dealing with criticies live from the idea that success or happiness depends on masting a challenge without being connected with a prosthetic case , because i could make the po
but the truth is that we change . of course , we &apos;re challenging from the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional or even both of them .
and i &apos;m suggesting that &apos;s good .
curiosities are not an obstacle that we need to curve to get better with our lives .
curiosity belong to our lives .
and i tend to see curiosity as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s constantly in me .
and i don &apos;t want to get the impact on the heavy of the heavy of a human .
there &apos;s in the lifes and challenges , and they &apos;re just all real and each person is different with it , but the question isn &apos;t whether we can come with curiosity or not , but how we
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve fate , but they &apos;re also preparing to get clearly .
and we don &apos;t process our children , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to see two things : to be amputated , to be amputated , and the other that social minds about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and remaining disability that i had to set apart is that the world constantly means it can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are heart and the cold , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a projection to life that you expect , we need to figure out that we don &apos;t
maybe that &apos;s the moment of concept that seems only on what is broken and how we repair that , for every single one of the major disabilities than the pathology is .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being holistically , and not perceiving all of its forces and opportunities and recognize the natural struggle that you might lead to , another disease .
we degrade a people who has a value for our society .
so we have to look at the pataology and focus on all areas of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our internationalities and our great invention , there &apos;s a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t review these challenging times or denial , we should not try to avoid them , we should turn them underneath the carpet , but it &apos;s about seeing the chances of opportunities .
i mean , it &apos;s more really about realizing that we don &apos;t have to overcome drugs , but we &apos;re open for them to hug them , put them on the creation to use them on the creation and mayb
and maybe we &apos;re going to create the directions as something natural , strange and useful , and feel like that through their presence through their presence .
in this year ago , we celebrate the 200th birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution , 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , something very real in the human charact
i would survive it as well , not the most powerful of his species , and not the most intelligent of his way , but who can adapt to change best .
conflicts comes creativity .
it &apos;s not just darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive , to survive and flourish , from the fight of the human mind , transforming through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of the human .
and perhaps we know for what wood we &apos;re cut if we were really cracked .
perhaps that &apos;s the meaning of curiosity , a perception of the ics , a sense of our own power .
we can give us something about it yourself .
we can give a new meaning that goes out over heavy times .
maybe we can see curiosity as change .
curiosities are standing for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve added ourselves is believe that we should be normal .
honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical . but not the normal . and would you really want to learn this poor , gray person , really , when you really gave ?
i don &apos;t think more .
it would be great if we could take this paradigm of the normality against another opportunity or the strength to formulate it a little bit more dangerous . so we can invite the forces of a lot of ch
anthropologists have found that we have been asked by people &apos;s members of our societies to be useful and affording a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals are having older people and people with heavy physical injuries , and that may be because the life experience was valuable for these people for society .
they didn &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i grew up in the city where i grew up in a food market in that &quot; red zone , &quot; in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood in front of a shelf tomato .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullin . &quot;
and i &apos;m turning around and see this older man . i had no idea who it is .
and i said , &quot; excuse , sir , you know , i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her for the first time , i &apos;d given them out of your mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so this .
and of course , it &apos;s done click .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew about this day because i was , of course , typically at my birthday two weeks to late .
and the doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was in the walk , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born without legs , and my feet would have done after them , and i only had a couple of toes on this and some toes on the other foot , and this stranger had to bring the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents that you would never walk , and he would never be so moving as other children , or you could never have an independent life , and since they were jus
really , remarkably , i found that he had collected newspapers on my entire childhood , whether i won the passion competition in the second class , whether i had the shippers or one of my sporting v
and he called this part of his course : the factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t really emphasize enough , how critical this factor can be the quality of a human life .
and dr. kean said , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , when you leave children itself , then children can 
you see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and somebody &apos;s dealing with it , two different things are .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you were asking my prostheses against legs and bones , then i wouldn &apos;t have related .
i didn &apos;t want to be able to do normal at the time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i experienced something with my legs , and not despite these experiences .
and perhaps this transformation could happen because i &apos;m so many people who opened me doors , instead of measuring people who wanted to restrict me or wanted to introduce an idea .
you see , it really needs a people who demonstrates you how to manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , internal forces , the human mind is so recent -- if you create that , and for somebody in a critical moment , then they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open yourself doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; rooted in the word &quot; educate &quot; in the word &quot; educate . &quot;
it means to produce something that &apos;s in one is to tickle the potential out .
again , what potential we want to call ?
in the &apos; 60s , britain was done a case study , and then gymnasies were transformed into total schools .
they call them there &quot; streaming trials &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are shared for grades .
and the students are really harder to get the better teachers , etc .
then they have given over a three-month period of students with a &quot; enough , &quot; the note &apos;s very well . and they told them that they were very smart , and after these three months , th
and of course , it breaks one of the heart that reverse has been said to the one student , they &apos;re just enough .
and that &apos;s exactly what it was , after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had shooting school .
it &apos;s quite critical about this study that teachers weren &apos;t going on .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something has changed .
they were just said that they were the one students , and these are the students with the note , and the same way they taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a broken spirit that &apos;s broken , has no more hope . he doesn &apos;t find anything more beautiful , it &apos;s missing our natural , child-like curiosity and our inn
but when we manage to support the human mind , continue to hope , themselves and other people around themselves , then curious and phantagious , then we put our forces really positive .
when a spirit has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new shapes .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem which was missed by a persian poet called haifi in the 14th century , and my friend jacques demois told me , and the poem is called &quot; the god &apos;s name , no
come , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose , i said that through few changes of your genes could have a better memory -- more precise and faster .
or want to be fitter , stronger , have more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how could it be living longer at good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always seeing for more creativity .
which one would you like the most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there &apos;s creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to look at the doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a continuing topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor to the subject .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t.g. dobahsky , who was also a communication in the russian orthodox churche , wrote an approach , with the title , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t
well , if you &apos;re one of these that don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch your hearing device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission
but when you accept biological evolution , it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it some other things , or is it affecting us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing species on the tops of these branches have succeeded in evo
the human part of this bush , at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the life , but actually the basic part , the basic mechanisms are quite same .
do you realize that we can use that and represent the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
this is not like human insulin , this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically underestibative of what comes from the pancreas .
and as we &apos;re talking about bacteria already , you know that every one of us in our gut leads more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think when antonio damasio asks for your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all nutrients that you could only want to offer without effort .
it &apos;s really an easy for bacteria with occasional interruptions of the unintended , honey forced to except .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for your life .
they help the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come in the future ?
are we in some kind of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that maybe even better to the environment ?
now let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living creatures -- the firs
in this giant unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is measured before , the animal kingdom , like a single tack , and the human life , a little note destruction .
that &apos;s what we were .
this is also hoping the entertainment of this speech , so i hope that they like you .
now , when i was a newine on college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell 
but at the time , as a multi-cellular organisms , things started to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , that genome passes , the rest of the body is essential .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our body in evolution is in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now , i have to stand when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but with each year , it seemed to be my increasingly dou
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings from george burns , who was leading his show in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a plap on his hotel room .
it opens the door .
before him , a beautifully dressed show .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the insight as a doctor that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictive , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the continued genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation to generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they and i developed like boster rockets to send the genetic force into the next stage of the orbit to make it fall into the sea .
i think we would all the mood , the woody all for expression brought to the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get through my work .
i don &apos;t want to achieve it by not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily prefer the longest lives .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution privileges the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and such survival .
on the ocean , the bacteria are thermophil , the thermphil are , and that &apos;s what the hot struggle would survive if fish were there , it would have a vacuum to do them , yet they were able to m
so , what does that mean when we look back , what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and especially what we &apos;re looking into the next phase , i wou
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons that we would be the first thing through medicine , to get a lot of genes that had been elected out of the other things and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species have been so configured our environment that we &apos;ve done that they &apos;re adapting to us , exactly what we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and circulate , and by the way , they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find out .
a second opportunity is that it &apos;s going to be an evolution of traditional ways , of course , excited by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly , but they &apos;re incredible .
and as far as its isolation , when we put as a species of planets , it &apos;s going to be isolation and the changes of the environment that could make evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a tricking , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it the neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just , but led and decided of us as individuals in the decisions we &apos;re doing .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we &apos;re doing this ?
let &apos;s look at the first of the reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their drugs .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose their child &apos;s gender , but also , in the body , the genetic adaptation that would heal and prevent the diseases .
what if they could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s , or eliminate the cancer risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
when we look forward , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
in the following year , when it finished in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more long until the reality is that it &apos;s going to give 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering released the drape prize for francis arnol and will strummer , two scientists that call the natural process of evolution that calls the natural proce
a couple of years ago , the laster price for scientists shinya yajanama was lost for his research that he took an adult skin cell , a fibrobast , and through the manipulation of only four genes , th
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that human insulin can make viruses that can &apos;t just protect themselves , but also the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang with vaccine against influenza that &apos;s been built into the cells of a tocact plant .
can you imagine something good that comes from tabacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future will be much more possible .
imagine just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells in your design ?
what if they could change the sperms and the ecultries or the fresh time change in order to give their children a better opportunity for a healthier life -- remote the diabetes , the hemophilians re
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , also could also allow us to adopt super-attibutes , hyper-capacities -- the better mem
why don &apos;t the strikeness of a ken jenning , especially , if you can extend it with the next generation of watson machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that are going to enable you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
they &apos;re going to be resilient .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by and style evolution to neo-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it in thousands of years , and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
do we use these choices to shape a society that &apos;s better that &apos;s more successful that is more friendly ?
or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want to have for some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to form a society that &apos;s more uniformed and uniformed , or more robust and more expansive ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to meet .
and the deepest of all , we will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need is to make these choices ?
in the good like in evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions are going to be .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you overhuman skills , or another one , the wheelchair driver helps to stand up and go again .
we at berkeley bionics called these robots exoskeletes .
they &apos;re not anything other than something that you stop in the morning , and that &apos;s going to continue their strength and help you increase their speed , for example , your balance .
that &apos;s actually the real messing of people and machine .
but not only that -- they merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who hears about 100 pounds on his back , and the question is that they should be wearing more equipment .
of course , this leads to some of the important complications -- spinal injury , 30 percent of it -- chronic reduction injuries .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human universal load carrier .
soldie : with the hulk excelleton , i can wear 200 pounds over different terrain , for many hours .
his flexible design allows you to hook deep and create the highest amount of movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go , and then increases my strength and expense .
we &apos;re the way with our industrial partners of this device , this new exoskeleten in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s look at our look at the wheelchair drivers , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who sit in the world &apos;s wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the entire population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a very young person with the spinal cord injury , which has been in their lifetime of their lives -- 20s , 20s , from the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only opt
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose numbers are multiplished .
and pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a brain , or for other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so for 500 years , by the way , since i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the area of mobility .
so let me just imagine you that &apos;s carried by amanda boxtel , who , 19 years ago , had a spinal cord injury , which was the result that it couldn &apos;t walk anymore for 19 years and up to now
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegas .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches that are sending signals back to our nobard computer that &apos;s here on their back .
here are also batterial packagings , the motor driven is on their hips , as like your pieces that you &apos;re moving forward in this pretty smooth and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in best , as a monstrous surface tree , while a skivaboard paralyzed me .
in fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my body .
not long after that , a doctor step in my disease , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steal every face of hope from my consciousness .
adaptive technologies have been since to learn how to drive again , driving again and drive up with your hands .
but nothing that would let me go back , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda and all the wheelchair drivers , but for everybo
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m developmental department called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i &apos;m going to fight as a fireman man in a volunteer deletion .
well , in our city , where volunteers supported a highly qualified professional support , you &apos;ve got to be pretty early on the burden to be able to mix .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the brand , so i had pretty good opportunities to be in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the responsible main man and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the main man , he had just in a very serious entertainment with the householder who has certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was middle on the middle of the night , and she was in the sleeping and barefoot under a screen out in the streaming rain , while her house stood in flames .
the other volunteer who would come in front of me -- let &apos;s call it lex luther -- reached the main man first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the home owner .
the dog ! i was speechless .
there was any lawyer , now for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he was in a burning house to save a living thing , because he was five seconds faster than i was five seconds .
well , i was the next next .
the main man would go to yourself .
he said , &quot; bezo , you &apos;ve got to go into the house .
you &apos;ve got to go up at the fire , and this woman have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i &apos;d hope to do , but i went up -- the stairs up , down the river , where the real &quot; firemen , over , who were pretty finished at that point with just a few shoes i
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met on the door door , and the beloved dog .
we were wearing our estimates outside to the home owner , where , not surprisingly , its essentially got more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the firewaker received a letter in which she thought for the beacher use in the rescue of their house .
one about everything estimated kindness : somebody had taken it a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin hood and in my next profession as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m struck by generosity and friendly in the great scale , but i &apos;m also looking at the motter of th
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i look around in this room and see people who have either accomplished an observative success or their way there , i want to offer this memory : wait not wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of another , until they got their first million .
if you &apos;ve got something , they give it right now .
they use in a soup kitchen , space a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day it &apos;s going to offer us an opportunity to save a human life , but every day provides us to change one .
so they put them , save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;ve just come back from a community that knows the secret of the humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women lead the ceptor with sex &apos;s hallo , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not burning or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your relative .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees together with chimpanzees are our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are famous for your aggressivity .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect overwhelmed in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the media .
while chimpanzees , while chimpanzees are led by big , the bonobo society is led to empowered females .
they &apos;ve really come up with what , because that leads to an extraordinary tolerant society in which the deadly violence has not been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under the primates .
they live in the depths of the congolese urbands , and they &apos;re very hard accessible .
the congo is a paradox -- a country &apos;s extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the action of a violent condition , which has been working for decade
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction also distributes the survival of the bonobos .
flesh and the decline of the tree participation leads that you couldn &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees shake .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; monkey , because you &apos;ve got a bisexual sex , with changing partners , and rules so conflict and social actinities .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the lives of the bonobos is more than the cama of sura .
bonobos -- how people -- love to play their lives .
game doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
for us , and it &apos;s playing fundamental to the treatment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
game is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you observe bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human laughs , dances and rituals .
play is the kit that &apos;s contributing to us .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique shots from the wild .
first , a game on bonobo art -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here we see a young female and males in a tracking game .
look at what it does .
this might be the evolutionary origin , &quot; she &apos;s packing it on the eggs . &quot;
only that i think it likes him , not true .
yeah .
so sex plays are spread , both bonobos and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea that you bring new elements into the game -- like the trads -- and how the
but the game is a form .
play is a forms , and it can take a lot of shapes that some of which are something smaller , phantasively , curious -- maybe to discover the amazing .
and i want to show you , that &apos;s fuco , a young female , and it plays peaceful with water .
i think just like they &apos;re playing sometimes alone , and we local limits of our interiors and outside worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research and interact and interact , and the unexpected links that we form , are the real number of creativity .
this is just a little task on the insights , the bonobos into our past and present .
but they &apos;re true also a secret to our future , a future that we need to adapt to increasing challenges through bigger creativity and profound cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptation .
in order to adapt us to an uncomfortable world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best out of our play ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life isn &apos;t from teeth and claws alone .
it &apos;s just when it seems to hardly , play might need to .
and therefore , my primate characters , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play it together , while we rediscover creativity in the company and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 , at the exact same day , every same day , everybody gets a baby .
so two couples , everybody gives a baby .
now i don &apos;t want them to imagine that too much time , because , if you imagine generation all the time , they &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you &apos;ll think that in a case , the sperm carries a y chomosome that meets to the x chromosome of the ocean .
and in the other case , the sperm is a chromosome that &apos;s meeting at the x chromosome of the one .
they &apos;re both survival , both of these .
we still get back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two huts .
underneath a hat , i &apos;m interested in the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied historian , and in this case , i &apos;m studying how people were able to do with anatomy -- human body , animal bodies -- how they surrounded with body fluids , with body fluids ,
the other one that i &apos;ve carried about my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as impatient lawyers -- from people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people , the body types , the social norms in question .
so for example , i &apos;ve been working with people , the siemesian twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people &apos;s ground -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often i &apos;ve been working with interesual people whose gender is generous -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the word interesuality .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of the possible types of gender , which don &apos;t respond to the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have somebody with a xy chromosome base , and the syr gene of the y chomosome , the protogona that we all have the protogona that we &apos;ve all growing up to dead .
and that &apos;s why the testosterone in the fetal stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosteron , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testor .
and that &apos;s called androgen receptor defect .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to that .
as a consequence , the body develops more of the typical female course .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s going to get up as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until they get puberty and growing their breasts and develop it , but it doesn &apos;t get their period until somebody gets something different .
and they &apos;re doing some tests , and they find that instead of earth and circulations , it &apos;s carrying themselves , and that it has a chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could hold this person for actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called adrenaline rises .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the beginnings are putting androgens that are virilizing hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome building , but i think i &apos;ve probably have the typical -- most of women like me talking a
we produce annoring , and we &apos;re talking about androgens .
and the consequence is that somebody like i actually has a brain that was more androgens than a woman who was born with hotes and has an androgen receptor defect .
so gender is really complicated ; intersatuals don &apos;t just stand in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way , they can be distributed across the whole range .
another example , a couple of years ago , i got the call from an 19-year-old man who was born as boy who was a boy , he was a friend of his girlfriend , and he lived , and he just figured out that h
he had an extreme form of an innated state hyperblash .
he &apos;s got 87 chromosomes , and in the womb , his besiness were so strongly active that they created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genitalians were exposed to male , his brain was exposed to the more typical male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody ever did something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he inside the mentructured that the doctors found out that he was inside .
okay , just a quick example for a variation of interesuality .
some people with x7 chromosomes , they develop something that ovotestics is , where stock tissue was around from head tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can reach in many different variations .
the reason why kids with these kinds of bodies -- because it &apos;s current or simeesic twins , because it &apos;s interesting -- from surgeons to be adapted to the norm is not because this would b
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why there are often different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomical expression comes with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman &apos;s means to have a female identity ; it &apos;s a black person , means to have an african anatomy in terms of your own story .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually represents something very different for us , that &apos;s confused in these categorizations .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing then if children are born , who are two people in one body .
in the last time i &apos;d experienced most excitement , south african groups in caster semenya last year whose gender was asked at the educator of the world championship berlin .
a lot of journalists called me with the question , &quot; what the tests are you going to tell us whether caster semeya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature doesn &apos;t move between male and female , or intersexually and intersexual , and in fact , we &apos;re interesting 
so we &apos;ve got a situation where the further our science progress , we have to understand that these categories that we held for stable anatomic categories , which are very simple conditions to 
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be much more complicated when our terminology has allowed .
in our looking at our looking , we &apos;re going into all kinds of uncomfortable areas .
we &apos;re pushing for example , for example , we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in common .
what should we start with the fact that we just distinguish through few nucleoties ?
while we &apos;re going to push our science and further , we get increasingly into a zone of the uncomfortable where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories that we had probably too simp
we &apos;re looking at this in all sorts of human lifes .
one of the areas in which we see this in our culture today , in the world &apos;s united states , they &apos;re fighting across the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what point a body is going to be a body so that he has another right than the fetal life .
we have very difficult conservations today -- maybe not so publicly like in medicine -- about the question , when somebody is dead .
our ancestors had never had hard to fight with the question when somebody was dead .
they have someone else higher than the nose , and when she moved , they didn &apos;t have them yet .
if they didn &apos;t move anymore , you burst them .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we humans are taking very important organs and they want to plant them to play other people .
and as a consequence , we struggle with the really difficult question , when somebody &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really difficult thing in which we don &apos;t have that simple categor
now you might assume that the entire collapse of categories are really happy .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are actually much more insecure than we thought that these categories are actually much more insecure than we thought that these categories are really much more inse
and it &apos;s related to me in terms of thinking about democracy .
so , to tell you about this tension , i &apos;ve got to know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were racists , i know they were sexists , but they were great .
i find that they were so bifter and strong , and so radical , in which they did , i &apos;ve looked at the musical musical in 1777 , and it &apos;s not because of music that is absolutely forgotten 
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the founding fathers .
the founding fathers were the original anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
and what they received was an anatomic concept , and they replaced it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers were doing the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the reviewers of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the birth right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the conception that people who had political power to have this political power because of the loved blood line from the grandfather to the grandfather to the son and so on .
the founding fathers knew this idea and replaced them through a new anatomical concept , and that concept said that all people were created .
they neveloped the play and decided that anatomically counted the commonalities , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they made that in part because they were part of an electric system where two things grew up together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time grew the science of the same time .
if you look at the history of the foundation father , clearly , many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world .
they went from explanations of operatural ways , and weat things , like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission has based on a very vague concept of birth .
they moved into a naturalistic concept .
and if you look at the independence explanation , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they gave us a concept of anatomical commonalities .
and with that , they actually prepared the future rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years ?
for example , women who asked the problem , the concept of the foundations , which says that anatomic difference is more important than the anatomic difference and said , &quot; that we should have 
and women argued that successfully .
next , the successful civil rights movement came , where we humans looked like souoner truth , who spoke about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the march of the civil rights movement that says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin colors calling on anatomical communities of anatomical differences , again , successfully .
we see the same in the disabled rights movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all of the communities , we need to start asking about why we &apos;re going to sustain certain separations .
well , notice , i &apos;d like to support certain separations , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should have the right to give your understanding of sex or married .
so there are some anatomic separations that make meaning for me , and that we think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what they are , and why we keep them and why they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that have been put on the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both of the same day in 1979 .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months , she &apos;s born in 1980 .
secret , on the other hand , will be born to the mirture , so he &apos;s born on the one march in 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria three months have been brought , they get all sorts of rights in three months before they have the right to have the right to have the right to drink the right .
here &apos;s not because he &apos;s actually a different biological age , just because of the point of time .
we &apos;re finding other significances about what their rights are .
herrica , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s male , because you take that he &apos;s male , he can now concern what maria needs to worry about .
maria can &apos;t perceive the same right that has healthy in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
the secret can be married a woman in every state , but maria can marry today in a few states today .
so we have these permanent anatomic categories that are problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science makes such advances in anatomy that we &apos;ve got to achieve that a democracy that could be considered in anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like the science makes itself .
so where are we going to go ?
it seems like our culture takes some kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to go anywhere a line , so we &apos;re pulling it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
so for example , texas on a point decided that there &apos;s a man to marry , that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and marry a woman to marry you &apos;ve got a y chromosome .
now in practice , people don &apos;t test to their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the androgen receptor defect .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he provides us in his , &quot; i have a dream of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be able to judge people &quot; their skin color , &quot; but after the property of their character , &quot; and it goes out as an anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
i want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we shouldn &apos;t be distributed in people &apos;s rights because i have to admit that i have a series of golden retrivers that probably make social
i want to say that i &apos;m probably knowing some bright labs down , the more capable of meeting more fundamental , more intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40-year-old
so how are we going to operationate the qualities of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and one part of me wondering , what if the content would be something that would be something that would be in the future of machine -- which could be made visible ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to make them thinking about questions of democracy .
in our variety of democracy , we did our things really well , and i think we would make our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , such as it &apos;s in iran , where a man who feels sexually moved to other men , with death , it &apos;s because he &apos;s ready to get a gender transformation w
states of these species are not existing with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago who had brought some simeesic twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was telephone , and he asked him why he made these interventions -- they were high-risky surgeries -- his answer that in his country , these children would be treated very bad , and so he
i said , &quot; how did you move political asyl instead of separating them ? &quot;
the united states offers incredible opportunities to allow people that they are , without they had to change the state .
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leading .
all right , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the opportunities as democracy could look like , if we were involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s really radical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that have a different kinds of anatomy , especially when people a
because i &apos;ve been interested in intersexuality for years , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the gender .
and one of the things i really found is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- more complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable to people who 
and so when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i made a graduate student , i asked me one of my study caregers who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so it &apos;s -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what is feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about solving cliches about gender , so therefore , feminism nothing is female .
but the more i thought about his question , i thought there might be something female in feminism .
this is supposed to be something , on average , which makes female brains of male distinctions , which makes us more attention for highly complex social relationships , and worry about the protectio
so where the founding fathers were extremely interested in figuring out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that when we brought more mothers into this concept 
and maybe it &apos;s where we &apos;ve got to go into the future -- when we take democracy across anatomy -- less about thinking about the individual body , which is identity and think more about re
so that , if we try to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jesso , and this is my suitcase .
but before i &apos;m going to show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is : i &apos;m obsessed with outsits .
i love to carry another colorful supportunity to carry crazy outfit , and the last time is photographing and blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy nothing new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand on markets and second-hand shops .
oh , thank you .
second-hand shopping allows me to reduce the influence of my degree on the environment , and also the one on my follow .
i meet all kinds of great people , my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique , and it makes you suppose to my personal shop .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
i &apos;m going to like the color .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers yes , i feel like i won .
i &apos;m going back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve spent for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does anybody bring with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought into seven underneath , and that &apos;s all .
weeks for exactly one week are everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have been that i would like to find everything that i might want to wear , if i got to palm springs .
and because you haven &apos;t heard of me when the woman who &apos;s going around here at ted in her underwear -- that means i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe or not that these adventures have learned to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call it the radiant tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including jacket cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve carried all this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad when you &apos;re wearing bright people .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation will overrate .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time of my life trying to be myself and adapt myself at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded with the right people , they will not only understand it , they &apos;re going to estimate it .
genetically , arm their inner child .
sometimes me people tell me i look like i &apos;m dressing &quot; games , or that i remember them to your seven-year old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost sure .
and if you think you &apos;re not good looking good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother that taught me the day of day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that short for her .
if you think they &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden paillets fit to everything .
and ultimately , saturday : developing your own unique , personal style , is a great way of telling something about one without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve been proving me and over and over this week , when people got to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit it all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all again .
because the lesson i &apos;ve been trying to learn from this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to attack these things , because the same around the corner will give it a different crazy , colorful , which is just waiting for me when i have a little bit love in the heart and
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you .
think about this as a flying education .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptial design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this picture in his room . but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that i &apos;m show
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula , then they took their budget , and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s going on in real time , some thousands of sensors , the information from the car , sending 
they would call it , in engineering , called a real time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a sensitive part and a responsive part .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real-time control systems are starting to start in our lives .
our cities have been , in the last few years , just extracted with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the free .
and as a computer in free , they start responding in other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
when we &apos;re doing cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
only by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- cause up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we &apos;re doing something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this perceive and drive in objects of the daily life .
this is from an exhibition , the paloa antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start talking about back to us .
in some sense , it &apos;s almost like each atom out there will be out there , a sensor and a driver .
and that changes radical the interaction that we humans have with our environment outside .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangel. ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped moses , it means that he took the hammer and throw it on mosses -- actually , you can still see a little bit of underneath -- and said , &quot; perchan non parli 
well , today , our environment starts for the very first time to answer .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , to perceive our environment .
let &apos;s start with perception .
now the first project i &apos;d like to imagine is actually one of the first our labs .
it came from four and a half in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone net -- and anonymous and aggregated information from this network to under
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was an italy won the football championship .
some of you are going to remember it was playing it was in italy against france , and then at the end of the zidans , the head-hot .
and no matter , italy won the end .
now look at what happened on this day , only when the activity that &apos;s happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle in the middle , the flow tibet .
in the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a tower . italy makes a tower .
half-time people make a short call , go to toilets .
second half . end of the normal play time .
first extension , second .
ziazan , in a moment of the head cover .
italia wins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate .
they saw the great expression .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the seeter and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you can see the picture of the place circo massiom , where , since the rome time , people go to celebration -- to have a large party , and you &apos;re looking at the suggestion at the end of the da
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
even quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but things that we &apos;re using and consuming .
well , today , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is , as they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to follow the waste while he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that helped us , a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , helped the things that they were twrowing -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things
then we have the little chips , the little brands on the trash , and started tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle .
after a week after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
we can do the same things actually with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this happens a lot of uncertain transportations and complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day that the cuts that we throw up , not just disappears that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still throwing there every day .
and if we show that to people , we can drive a behavioral change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at the mit , asa , biderman , could tell you much more about perceiving , and the many other wonderful things you can tell with perception , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second par
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain a few years ago .
it started with a question of the mayor that came to us and said that spain and south europe have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that have been developed at mit in a work circle , imagine these tracks , and valveline , magnetic ventiles , which open and close .
they &apos;re causing something like a water that &apos;s going on with points from water .
if these images fall down , they can write them , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can close to him , and it &apos;s going to open up to let them jump through , as you can see on this picture .
well , we &apos;ve introduced the mayor hellow .
it &apos;s really like it .
and we got the commission to design a building at the expose of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavilion .
the whole building was from water .
there are no doors or windows , but when they close to him , it &apos;s going to open and let them in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s wind , if you want to reduce the syringes , they can even let the roof .
or you could close the building and all the architecture , like in this case , you know , that day , when you go down the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you destroy 
no , you don &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappear .
this is how the building works .
you see the person who wonders what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you &apos;re looking at me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not to become wet .
well , i should tell you what happened one night than any sensors stopped to work .
but actually , it was an even larger fun this night .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that opens up in order to let them , but a building that still had pisses and holes in the water , you had to jump without anything .
and that , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interacting with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical images , the images of water and the projections .
and that &apos;s what brought us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these points could really begin to fly .
imagine that you could have little helicopters that fly through the air , and each one of you with a little image with changing light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier that moves with others , completely synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have some kind of flexible screen or displays like this -- an equal formation in two dimensions .
or irregularly , in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of the image .
they can play with different ways .
imagine before the screen might just appear in different formats or sizes in different resolutions .
but then that might be only a 3d cloud that you can go to , and where they move through which they can look at many , many directions .
here you see a real flyfie control that &apos;s going down around like shaping an equal too .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so the same way we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people are controlled .
it could have an impulse of every single impulse that comes from people , of the movements of people or the same .
i want to show you something first of all .
we &apos;ve been working with robert boll , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the etiol of the metropolitan theater in new york and the scale -- we took their movements in 3d to use them
here &apos;s roberto sancing here .
on the left , you &apos;re looking at the images , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a real time scan and a movement recording .
so that they can figure out the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the pictures , they can play with it and play with color movement and movement .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyfier .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working for the olympic games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people with something and changing the environment -- almost like we call the cloud movement about how to call the chicken , but wi
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for an image point .
i think the remarkable thing that happened last years is the last decade is that we &apos;ve changed by a physical world .
this has all digitized , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , we can take for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- we can change from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks in the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to make us ask the coming challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical .
so the idea is that we actually involve the people where they do things together , collectively do .
the cloud is again a cloud of educations , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of educations .
it &apos;s a physical shape in london , but covered with points .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , the most important moments for olympia in 2012 and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical clouds in the sky , and something about what they can go , like london &apos;s new mountain .
you can go in .
and one kind of digital light tower in the night -- but as most importantly , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
an artist , the context is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people aren &apos;t separated by nature , and that it &apos;s all connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first icebern .
i &apos;ve gotten away .
my heart rast , my heart , while i was trying to figure out what was before .
the icebers around me , about 60 meters of the water , and i could only concern that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year after year .
icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier or by breaking out of ice cools .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact with their environments and their experience .
some people refuse to give up and climbs up to the bitter , while others are not going to stop and put the dramatic passion .
if you look at an iceberg , you think that they &apos;re isolated , separate and alone , as we humans are often seeing .
but the truth is far away .
while an iceberg melts , i breathe its precious atmosphere .
during the iceberg , he &apos;s putting minimously drinking water free that feeds lots of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of these icebergs , as i &apos;m going to do portraits of my ancestors , where consciousness , they exist in this way , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt -- it &apos;s not an end , but a perception of their path along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the icebergs i &apos;m photographers is very young -- some thousands of years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show an iceberg that i &apos;ve photographed in geneland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually struggling with a rolling iceberg .
so here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , where he &apos;s in the water line .
you can see here , he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
that &apos;s the average size of a greenland iceberg .
he &apos;s going about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like , the iceberg shows another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but in the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is tempet .
temper was one of the leading graffiti artists of the &apos; 80s .
then one day he came back from walking , and he said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
temp is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use its eyes .
i stood up with this .
i have a company that makes design and animations , graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world .
so we &apos;ve decided , tony -- tempt -- and supporting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back to him and i asked , &quot; well , that &apos;s not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all paralyzes communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just when you hear the higher society layer and you have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how communicates yourselves ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &apos;s butterfly and diver block ?
that &apos;s how they communicate -- their fingers are running .
i standed , &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just put a check , and instead , i put a check that i didn &apos;t have the lovely idea how i was going to engage it .
i committed to place and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my suggestion is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;ll get him an apparatus , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can 
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s carrying all this , it can &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these people of gla , graffiti research , and they have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface , and then drawing with a laser point to register the negative surface .
so they pull around and do art installations like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there , follow a life cycle .
it starts with the gender , and then the bash words come , after the bush implications , and finally , people actually make art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home and at at night with my wife , and we told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , seconds , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control thing
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we &apos;ve received the insurance the doors , and actually get an approach to communicate that he can communicate -- a stephen hawking machine .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you &apos;re talking to him , or gets an email , and i think , &quot; i &apos;m so unfortunate , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we &apos;ve lost seven programmers all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i &apos;ve moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and construction theorists and anarchists have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautifully stupid to do that , and we got back , and all the images on the walls would be weight .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the beach promote in venice , my children were introduced , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyeritrirs , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap solar glasses that we bought on the beach project of venics , some copper wire and some of the things from the treatment and the electronic trade .
we took a ps per camera , they put them out , and they &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s free , and now we can build it , we can build the code for free , the software can be downloaded for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
no insurance can be able to show up .
there &apos;s no hospital .
each paralyzes can actually communicate alone with your eyes and draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temps .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s now all this squeez before the great development .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programmer , two weeks of programming and through nights , draw tony for the first time again after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
we &apos;ve tended his bed so that it can see outside .
we put a projector against a wall of the parking lot of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the best of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
so funny , we had to break into the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the speaker scene .
at the end , he sent an email with this content : &quot; for the first time i did something for seven years .
i feel like i was pressed underwater , and finally somebody moved down to the bottom and moved my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s something like our fighting script .
that &apos;s holding us in the stanger and let &apos;s develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s going to come up with a magic .
and someone who has an artistic potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re about figuring out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all sorts of recognition .
we won a few prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves .
it &apos;s everything from our own pockets .
so the realities were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong tweeted over us , and then , in december , honored the time magazine than one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really classroom .
the coolest thing is -- and that closes the entire circle -- that it &apos;s this april , where moca in the inner city of los angeles will give you an exhibition called &quot; art of the streets . &
and that &apos;s where probably the hardest representatives of the street art scene -- banks , shepard fairey , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is pretty good .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyergiter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- they all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never done something to do with an eye-opening technology , but i just came up with amazing people , so that we could communicate something on the legs .
and that question should be asking you , and in every single day where something needs to be done , because if not now , when ? and if i don &apos;t who , who ?
thank you .
so , i &apos;m writing for children , and it &apos;s probably america &apos;s most letter children &apos;s bookstore .
and i &apos;m always telling people that i don &apos;t want to get like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , one experience is something that you &apos;re finding because you &apos;ve left it anywhere .
you &apos;re looking around the block , and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has done it -- richard bolling broke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle started at the high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten in the young toilet every week in the young toilet , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilets in the teacher .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was beating to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and at that time in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to record an aids organization .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , woman posting , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found him .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve got pancreatic cancer , and i want you to please . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we were crying , and we knew it had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we were taking care of them , and we gave their family eight because it was needed .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , met me , turned it into a box and became my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve been talking about .
the revelation , the death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved them .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this was so often mentioned here today .
it takes the same -- he needed , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while they go up to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a piece of piece , the clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack .
that sounds afraid .
well , i had a unique space that day , and i sat down to 1d .
i was the only thing that could talk to the flights .
so i looked at the same thing , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had been turned the machine , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot did the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
he switches the power .
imagine a soundless airplane .
and then he said three words -- the most emotional words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; let &apos;s move to the impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the charge .
i could see it in their eyes , and there was striking , life was to end .
i &apos;d like to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a hand and didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to look at all the
while i was thinking about that , and i was thinking about it , who is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is , and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to shift something in life .
and that urgency , this goal has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned from that day -- and that was , when we were missing the george washington bridge , as pretty much hair spread -- i thought , human , there &apos;s one thing that i really
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i approached to become better in everything that i packed up .
but in my humanity , i was given my ego space .
and i refused the time that i wasted for meaningful things , with people who meant something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to burn negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t argue with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have rights ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s where the inner car starts , &quot; 15 , 13 , 13 , 13 . &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts of how to know it from documentation .
and as we put out , i had this feeling , human , to die is not terrifying .
almost like we &apos;d prepare our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really formed in a thought , which is that i just want one thing .
i just wished me , i could see my children .
about a month after that , i went to the performance of my daughter -- first grader , not a lot of artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i celebrate , i &apos;m like a little child .
and in the world , everything makes a sense of me .
i realized , at the time , by relating the dots to each other that it &apos;s going to be a great father to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i became the miracle to die on that day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future and come back and live differently .
my call for everybody who &apos;s flying today is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , because you think you would be forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , you &apos;re the best parents that they can be only ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxiet computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want the iran building the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the uranium institution institution in natance .
the gray boxes you see here , they &apos;re real-time control systems .
if we can now compromise the systems that control what threats and vants , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with windows software ; they base on a completely different technology .
but if we create it that an effective windows virus insists on a laptop that &apos;s used by an engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the planning behind stuusent .
so we start with a windows dropper .
the uses are going to be transformed into the gray box , the centrifuges and the iranian energy program demands -- mission .
this is a child game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found it .
when we started our research to stuxnet about six months ago , completely unknown , what was the meaning and purpose of this construct .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the windows part , the dropper part , he made from number of zero-day away .
and it seemed to be something , with these gray boxes , these real time control systems .
and this provided our attention , and we started a laboratory project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this construct .
and then something strange happened .
stuxiet was like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheeses -- switched , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t do sense in my eyes .
and after we experimented with different kinds of cheese , that &apos;s what this is an attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the dropper is actively on the gray box , when a particular configuration was discovered , even when the particular program that &apos;s trying to infect on this goal .
and if it doesn &apos;t , then stuxnet doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , the real interest , and we started working with it , almost around the watch , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could , like , let &apos;s say , a u.s. american power station , or a chemistry in germany .
so we should figure out what the goal is .
so we extracted , and we decomplisted the attack code and found that it &apos;s been structured in two digital warships -- a smaller and a bigger .
and we also felt that they were very professionally constructed by people who had obviously all inside information .
they knew any bits and bytes that they had to attack .
they actually knew the shoe size of the machine record .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already got that the dropper of stuxnet complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the uses are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about here -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks pretty like old-fashioned language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart out of this code .
so what we &apos;re looking for first was system function because we know what they do .
and then we looked for timers and data structures and trying to get them with the real world -- with potential targets in the real world .
and so we needed theories about these goals that we could recover .
in order to get these theories , we call up memory that it &apos;s definitely high sabbats , and it has to be a high quality goal , and very probably it &apos;s in iran because most of the infection
well , in this area , there are not several thousands of goals .
basically , it &apos;s going on the bushea of nuclear power and the uranical attacks in natance .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for centrifuges and power plants from our client &apos;s tribe . &quot;
and i called her , and i called her knowledge to compare what we &apos;ve found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital footprint with the rotational connection .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually explode the centrifuges .
and what we &apos;ve found is that the target of the attack was actually slowly and incredibly happening -- obviously , in the attempt to get the waiting engineers , so they wouldn &apos;t be able t
the great digital ray head -- we got an insight by looking at very different data and data structures .
so for example , the number 144 is really out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i started working through scientific literature , about how these centrifuges are built in natance and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called cascaden , and every cascade contains 44 centr
so that made sense , it would come together .
and it became even better .
these centrifuges in iran are divided in 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the attacks ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good together .
and this gave us great confidence that we studied here .
well , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like that .
these results were reached by several weeks of hard work .
and we often run into a deck , and we needed to collect us .
anyway , we found that the two digital warships are actually controlling on an and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little group heads over a cascade , and the rotors and the rotors down , and the great grand head starts with six cascaden interaction and manipulating valves .
so , basically , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determine what the goal is .
it &apos;s natane , and it &apos;s just nature .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really cut me from the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box , and on the top , you see the centrifuges .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s designing the interest values of sensors -- so for example , pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate code available dur
and actually , this wrong dita of stuuunte is actually before .
so it &apos;s exactly like in hollywood films , where during the processing hanging , the surveillance camera is found with before .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
and the idea here is obviously not just that the machine people in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to stress a digital security system .
we need digital security systems there where a human machine response can &apos;t respond quickly enough .
so in a power station , for example , when the great stuff is going to be quickly , you &apos;ve got to open distribution valves within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so , at this point , we need digital security systems .
and when the endangerements , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and not the machine leaders , the security system is going to notice .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
he has nothing particularly doing with centrifuges , with unance .
so for example , it would work exactly the same way -- in a power station or an automobile factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to take the use of the usb about an usb stick , as we &apos;ve seen it at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and when you do that , you get a cyber mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most difficult environments .
we need to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start preparing for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been reported a lot of things that people suspect that the message is the main organization .
is it also your opinion ?
okay , you want to really know this ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for getting us to have the home . thank you ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years to place myself in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time somehow dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i filmed in wars -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing that &apos;s eating here -- fun at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous in the middle .
actually , i &apos;ve been exposing most of my career that seems to expose for terrible situations , and all of this for trying to explore and interesting , and hopefully in a kind of understanding 
so when i knew i would come here to look at the world of branding and sponsoring , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
some of you may have heard about it a couple of weeks ago , a display on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent some facebook news , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to understand named rights in my tedtalk .
really , some happy people and companies , for profits and non-profits , received the only chance -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson was never going to let it back -- the name rights on t
so what you got was , your name here is presented : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and you could fly after content for your ears , especially when i got her compa
but that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of things .
this is just the work title .
so , despite that warning , i knew that somebody would buy the name rights .
so if you were asking me about a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say this with certainty .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new movie , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been in some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing so difficult and so dangerous as these guys go into a space .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film around product placement , marketing and advertising , which all the movies are funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and the movie &apos;s going to call &quot; the greatest movie sold , &quot; which is called &quot; the greatest movie sold . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the greatest movie even sold , &quot; is that everything from up to the end , from the beginning , totally with brands -- from the front that you see in the movie
now this brand , the qualiomom stadion , the stack center ...
these people will be connected with the film in edicity -- forever .
and so the movie &apos;s going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eventy , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to concrete .
it was &quot; in eggeness , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand as a title sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell each possible category in the movie .
that &apos;s what we sell a shoe and he &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever discovered , from &quot; the greatest movie ever sold , &quot; the greatest drinks they have ever had , an attention of &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . 
so the idea is , except showing that brands are part of the life , actually , get them to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the entire film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of states .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , all the film , from the beginning to end .
and i &apos;d look forward when cege would help to reach this .
you know , it &apos;s fun , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be really people .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because that has a negative connettion -- but you know how this will develop ?
how much money is needed to realize this ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s valuable to respond some really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a horrid of vollidiots .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
so , you know , not that optimistic .
so , my gentleman , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about which brand .
yeah .
if you look at the people that they have to do ...
there are some places that we can turn to us .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera in &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a background .
it turns out that it meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just like these companies , all these companies , one after the other .
none wanted to do something to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they were absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising is to present your product so many people as possible to see it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media , and the destricted media landscape -- is it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting instrument that mass takes thi
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was something .
actually , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t be a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you put transparency in the google search , this is one of the first images that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and dots , just discovering and looking through ; immediately , characterized by visibility and access to information , especially what busin
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot of a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes , that it &apos;s supposed to be implemented , something &apos;s changing .
but why ? well , transparency is frightening -- like this strange bear , which is still schooling .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landstreet .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole school of cool wips eat .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father got me at lying -- and there he sits , and he looks at me with this view -- would he say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency was willing to help us -- and it &apos;s only because i knew john bond and richard kirsh tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had
so what they suddenly started understanding -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to understand , there &ap
i have friends who make the great , giant hollywood films , and i &apos;ve got friends who make little independent films like me .
and my friends , the great , giant hollywood films , say the reason their movies are so successful at the brand partners they have .
and then my friends who make little independent movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant hollywood films ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
so how do we see ban in the movie ?
every time i &apos;m going to do on the way , and whenever i open the medical change , you &apos;ll see ban dedorating .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview .
are they ? you &apos;re looking at a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe they should be in front of the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we provided one of these great pieces .
either &quot; floral fusion , &quot; or a paradise wind , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men and for women -- first , rollen , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short session .
now i can answer all your questions and give them an exceptional constitution .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a challenge as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so making things like this -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe banes ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
the technology technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the switches .
we &apos;re talking about cows , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh , &quot; is a super word that this category really makes something positive , in contrast , &quot; fighting and humility . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times freshers .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million companies .
what about me ? what about the predge type ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that &apos;s like me , otto normal consumers .
they &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like really beautiful clothes .
in &apos;s &apos; 80s revival &apos;s meeting on skates place , except on the day .
well , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
unique .
i think the genes , the style i have is &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many gray and such stuff .
but normally , i have an accessories , like solar glasses , or a jewelry and so one stuff .
if you were a brand , it would probably be a classic mercedes cabrio .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , flying fly .
woman 2 : in part hippie , part of brooklyn girls -- i don &apos;t know .
man three , i &apos;m the school system .
i &apos;m selling schools around the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was delivered .
man 5 : branded alcohol experience writer .
does that go ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an anger brand .
i &apos;m tome .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tome brand , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of dark glamour and more flying fly .
and what realized was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who really could help me understand what &apos;s called &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson kaltman in pittsburg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nestle , ferference , helmark to discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for those , they could also help me .
you &apos;ve brought their pictures , right ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to their thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
md : this world , i think , your own world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all of these things come and start from one place and for me and start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the thoughts and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are quiet . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the machine ? what puppet stage you &apos;re now ?
why is it important to research ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
what kind of metaphors have they go through ?
... what kind of rollers do you find ?
eee : no , thank you .
thank you very much .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it .
there was a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that your brand personal dection has two separate pages , but the morgan spurlock mark is an eight-way played brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- avoiding things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re afraid , these elements , and they actually transform them for themselves , an
what other brands are ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , mini coopers and jebble .
well , there &apos;s playful brands and viewing brands , these things that come and go , but a playful , significant brand is a pretty strong thing .
it &apos;s an elevation , played brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody would ask them to describe their brand dentity , how would you ?
you &apos;re an up-attribut ? are you something that brings blood in walls ?
or are you a down attribut ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quieter , reservative , more conservative ?
up attributes are things that are played , fresh like the fresh prince , time , adventurilly , and literally like erol flynn , and agil , profane , herrish , magic and mystically as powerful .
or are they more like a down attribut ?
are they eight and moons like in 1707 ?
they &apos;re established , traditionally , protecting , powerful , compassionate as oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , familier , safe , holy , considered and ways like the dalai lama or you ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and the no , because they weren &apos;t going to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything to do with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , no control of the product .
but will never found 17 brand partners who were willing to deal with this control that wanted to do with somebody &apos;s business , and playing like me , and that finally told us to tell stories th
they were afraid to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story of the neuromarket that you &apos;re using mris to transmit the functional centers of the brain and making films .
we went to sao paulo , where they &apos;ve been banned .
in the entire city , for five years , for five years , no posters , no flyer , nothing .
and we drove in school districts , where companies their way in their way in their ways , all over america .
the incredible for me is that the projects i got the most feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they surrounded the middle man , they took the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people bring to think about challenging our world .
and how was that for you ? what &apos;s successful ?
well , because the film at the sundance film had festival , we can look at that .
and according to burrelle , the premises in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this movie .
it &apos;s actually just a time period of two and two weeks .
this is only online -- no press , no television .
the film wasn &apos;t delivered yet .
there &apos;s not even online . no streaming .
he &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , eventually , the movie has got a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost every advertising that we were talking about to recommend their customers that make fingers from it .
something i believe is that when you get your opportunity , risks is that there are possibilities in these risks .
i think if you put people out of it , then you bring them closer to failure .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you prepare the whole company to get a profit .
i feel like we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have fear of possibilities that you might scare .
finally , in progressing , we should call the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . you welcome the risk .
there &apos;s a large solution that &apos;s what we welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , gets us very far .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they presented transparency from my good friends of emce , who paid 1100 for the name rights in ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world .
emce presents , &quot; they welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , morgan , in the name of the transparency , what &apos;s happening right now with the 1700s ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket to the upper organization of the ted organization , the sapling foundation -- a check in the height of 3400 to fund my ted at the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i made something else in google , and i raised to do something with museums and art . my chesi that &apos;s today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , which i can tell you , with about 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and her access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i don &apos;t complain -- but i didn &apos;t have too many museums , and these art works didn &apos;t access .
when i traveled , and visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this desire -- art accessible to lead together with technology .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you &apos;re just going to googlerroproject.com.
you can look here in all these museums .
there &apos;s the uffici , the moma , the hermitage , the risk , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you &apos;re going to come into two ways -- very simple .
click , and worm , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re going around , and you &apos;re amusing .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and you jump up with a click .
they are , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
only one . lot of fun .
they &apos;re driving .
thank you , but the best comes up .
so now i &apos;m before a my favorite picture , heries of pieter broken in the met .
i &apos;m looking at this plug .
when the museum has given us the picture , click on it .
this is one of the images .
these are all the metadatas .
and those of you who are really interested in clicks here , but i &apos;m clicking it away .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been stuck with the so-called gigapic technology .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion images ? &quot;
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can go in very easily and out .
you see something fun this .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to be in .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
and i thought , &quot; moment , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went right , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i studied a little bit with some familiar with the met , and found out that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a gan at the breathing service will be beaten with a stick with a stick .
seemingly , it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
in order to go close , you can go to the missions .
just to give you overview , i &apos;m going to see what you get what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best comes up -- it &apos;s still -- in a second .
let &apos;s just quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to look at the paint structure ?
and what only if you want to see how gay gogh &apos;s going to create this masterpiece ?
you can really go in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorites of this picture until i really be with the cuts .
that &apos;s star night , never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of others , but i &apos;m missing the time .
that &apos;s really cool part , he &apos;s called collections .
each one of you , everybody -- rich or poor whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create their own museum -- from all of these images , they can put their own collection .
simple , they go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the zoom -- you can zoom .
this is &quot; the sand , &quot; in the national gallery .
you can send everything with their friends , send their friends , and so one entertainment starts about what they feel when they look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , is the main thing , that all the wonderful things are not here from google .
they don &apos;t even come from museums .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re just going to be right with this digital medium of art and represent them online .
and that &apos;s the biggest question that &apos;s recently asked me , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to get the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two half .
this is the left half that &apos;s the logical side , and then the right half that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the aptitute of every hemisphere , we could represent their brain .
for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this is somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
well , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think that most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high aptitute that &apos;s in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so what we &apos;re going out and play with it , and then we look at how it responds , and then we start developing in our intuition .
basically the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can only be on a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think about this thing at the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed .
i remember seeing a child in playing on a floor threshold .
he was a little child , and not very good at it , and he was constantly .
but i bet him taught him to play a very valuable lesson , which is the big thing you don &apos;t just leave you , and they &apos;re staying on a place .
and this is a great conceptional model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not particle physicists .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they &apos;re not playing with ground , but with these little strange particles .
and when you play with your particles , you &apos;ll imagine all kinds of strange things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that you can be two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all of these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago , you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe the great everyday objects to describe around us .
that didn &apos;t like my intuition , and that may because i &apos;m not so often playing with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it .
because if all these things are particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel clearly better with all the things , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i did a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i increase it . we &apos;re looking right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a spring board , and it &apos;s above the edge .
so i did this thing in the similar ways you make a computer chip .
i went a clean space with new silicons , and rocked for 100 hours on all the great devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this one like a swimming pool and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be the quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all sorts of strange things , but then other people are going , and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to get them with it ,
so quantum mechanics says that evidence objects feel the same .
the companions for unpoverable objects are not just people , but the light that seems to them and the wind that seems to them and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal behaves quantum mechanically , we needed to charge the whole corporate .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we switched the light , put it in a vacuum , and they said the whole air , and cooled it up to almost now , all alone in the elevation , the piece of metal is free to behave it wanted to behave .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
rather than it &apos;s just there , vibrated . the way it vibrated was about like this -- like this one and together , moving bubbleball .
in which we gave him a little piece , we were able to vibrate it at the same time and not to vibrate -- something allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is something that &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that the piece of metal is still , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
they &apos;re just precisive times they &apos;re overwhelming .
the rest of the time is decocalized .
that means every atom at the same time is two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal is metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth including me for all this year in the clean space , because , consider that , the scale difference between a single atom and that piece of metal is about the difference between the pi
so if a single atom at the same time can be two different places , this piece of metal can be metal in two different places , why isn &apos;t it also ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine you would be the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with that your body is delocalized in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we watched it , turning the light , and it looked in , we saw that the piece of metal is always there in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all of the objects on the elevator is just quantum objects that are driven in a small space together .
you hear a lot of talks about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind that , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should reconceptualize how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they gave them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competitio
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world , which is not even a single city that they were welcoming .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more than it costs to build them .
so we could actually extract the world very simply with dozens , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now that sounds absording for you , you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just take the construction of the homes against the cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in apartments , that &apos;s already , but the other half of the other half .
you could try to expand the capacity of the everywhere existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to end up with , in these apartments and their environments to avoid the laws to avoid complaint and distribute .
so it turns out to be very difficult to get all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new residential building , predicted the laws there would support one of these buildings and not disabled .
so i proposed that governments create new surfaces that give enough place for a city , and give them a name : charter cities .
and later , i found that something about the same time , javers and octavios have thought about the challenges of a reform in hondras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 hoursans left their country to get into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their count
at this point , jafeer said to octivio , &quot; what happens when we take an unfolding surface of our country , what if we just give them a message , we can work under the canadian rules or the unit
in the summer of 2009 , honduras live under a present constitution crisis .
in the next planning elections , pepp lobo would won in a commitment that program is both innovation and also simply promised .
he challenged octavio to become his staff .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , try and try through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city on the essence of elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t destroy existing apartments .
we &apos;re giving new technologies big conservation , but for progress , it needs technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him jaft .
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the chairman of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to do clearly , how valuable cities are , they &apos;re how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i &apos;ve used this graph to show how valuable rawand is in a place like new york . think about a surface in some cases per square meter of thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , on a place when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk was in very simple form that a charter city is a place that &apos;s uninhabited country , a founding contract that goes down there , and people &apos;s possibility offers to decide to
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we need to realize this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to get our country .
i was asked to come to tuchigala , and again , at the fourth and fifth january , i was asked to hold a talk .
and so i thought another with fact filled talk , which has contained a graph like this that tries to understand that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of deneer , and the sketch provides the new airport that was built in denver .
alone of these airports has an area of 100 square kilometers .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hondurans if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand morning .
politely , all have applauded .
the faces of the audiences were very serious and attention .
the head of congress came on the stage and has said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the process that a new city offers new opportunities .
there was the opportunity to live in a city that &apos;s in hondura , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also closes new possibilities for leadership .
the leaders of the government in hondura would be dependent on the help from partner countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that they would trust that everybody can trust that t
and the realization of president lobo , was that the certainty of the investors i thought about as a way to get the foreign investors and build this city for all parties in honduras for many years b
we &apos;ve driven into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s extremely thousands of square kilometers .
and shortly after that , on january , they have voted in congress for a constitution to have a constitutional constitution that &apos;s essential for special developmental areas .
in a country that has just behind a huge crisis behind congress was elected with 144 to a voice .
all parties , all the fractions of society , supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , but it &apos;s twice through congress .
on february on the 17th , it became the second time with 141 to a voice .
immediately , after this choice , between 21 and the 24th and the 24th , a delegation of about 30 hundreds traveled to the two places of the world that were most interested in increasing in the busi
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that was built in south korea -- big than the city center of boston .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years after it took four years to get permissions .
the other place that was very interested in cities is singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re practically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already have a bunch of bills , and they &apos;re already this surface for the second city .
it &apos;s already worked on a legal system that managers allows to participate , and it &apos;s also worked on an external legal system .
one country has already offered his top court &apos;s top court as a court for the discoveries of the system .
also cities designers and farmers are very interested .
they even bring finance with one .
one of the things you &apos;ve already known was been explained , there &apos;s a lot of months .
there &apos;s a lot of operations that would like to deal in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who like to live there .
all over the world , there are 700 million people who are suggesting that they like to live in a different place .
one million people are leaving latin america and walk into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to look for their families , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers that have to make enough money to afford and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s sometimes children who are trying to find their parents that , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen their parents for a decade .
so what &apos;s an idea to think about thinking about building honduras a completely new town ?
or even dozens of these cities , distribute hundreds around the world ?
so what is it for an idea that each family has a choice between several cities that are in competition around new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions are doing on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions are meeting in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions that makes a typical american on a day is 70 .
and also , recently made a study with ceos where she watched the ceos a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics with which these ceos have engaged , and how much time they spent with the issues that come together with the subjects .
and they found that the average ceo is engaged in the week with 139 tasks .
each one of these issues , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were met within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions are meeting in the nine minute category of those in the one hour of category ?
how well , do you think they &apos;re going to do the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest decision-making problems of our modern times , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise you , because i &apos;m blind , only your hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today : are you ready to hear something about the decision-making problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford , i went to this very exclusive food store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store , the predator .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure park .
they had 250 different species of mustand eating , and over 500 different kinds of frequents and vegetables and more than two dozen different ways of water -- and that was at a time we have actually
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time , i wondered , &quot; well , how does you never buy something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oils , including those who were including in boxes that came from thousand-year-old olive trees .
so one day i decided to visit the filial and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed on the burdles of tourists who came and commonly had their cameras .
we decided to business an experiment , and we chose marmleds for our experiment .
here &apos;s your mammal .
they had 384 different kinds of marmled .
we &apos;ve set up a little equipment corner directly at the end of the business .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes for marmilade or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things -- first of all , i &apos;d have this case more people are standing and trying to try
there are more people standing when they were 24 , about 60 percent , as if they were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we saw in which case people bought more likely a glass of marmalade .
now we saw the reverse effect .
from people who were staying when we were 24 , just three percent bought a glass of marmade .
from the people who stayed when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of gas .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times more of a glass of marmlades when they had six to the choice as if they had 24 to the choice .
well , to decide not to buy a glass of marmlades is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tails -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is affecting us in very conseq
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s going against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i did with gue huberman , my camenica , where we did the decisions to saving for the retirements of almost a million americans from about 650 plans in th
and what we looked at was whether the number of foundations that were possible to a retirement savilan , the 401 plan , the likelihood is affecting whether it &apos;s saved for the morning .
and what we found is that there was a connection .
in these plans , we had about 657 plans that provide the people between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more fonds were offered that , in fact , the more rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that the two funds had a participation participation in the &apos; 70s -- still not that we want it .
in the plans that almost 60 fends , the participation participation fell on about the sixtyest percent .
now it turns out that even if they participate in decision when more opportunities stood to choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more of the things that the more possibilities they were available , the more they avoid them to choose it and fonds .
the more possibilities they were available , the more they put their entire money into pure money .
none of these extreme decisions , heard to the decisions that somebody would recommend if their future financial well-being is important .
well , over the last 10 years , we &apos;ve been watching three essential negative consequences that makes the offer of more and more choices .
they &apos;re going to pull the decision -- get up , even when it &apos;s going on against their own best .
they meet more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide for things that they &apos;re even less happy , even if they &apos;re doing it better .
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy these huge shelves of mayonasis , sense , expensive and marmeld , but we can &apos;t draw the comparisons and distributions , and then actually choose
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- that you can just apply in your business .
first of all , limitation .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today that less more .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing away .
but in fact , we see it more and more that if they &apos;re willing to limit , and more that they &apos;re ready , and then there &apos;s an increase of selling , it &apos;s going to reduce the cost
as a proctor and gamble , the different head and shoulder &apos;s species of 26 , they experienced an increase in selling for 10 percent .
when the golden cat cat corporation was going to 10 of the worst , they were experiencing that the profits come to 87 percent -- a result of both , the increase of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average supermarket today , provides 45,000 products .
a typical walmart provides 100,000 products .
but the ninthest supermarket , the ninthest supermarket in the world , is aldi , and they only give them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in dose .
now in the world of saving , i believe one of the best examples that are recently got to the market , about how to manage the choices , something that david labison has very strong , it &apos;s a pr
every single harvard employed now automatically parts on a lifetime .
the ones that really want to meet a choice will offer 20 fonds , not 300 or more funds .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limite it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m the employee question , &quot; tell me how the opportunities are different from each other .
and if your employees they can &apos;t get their employees , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
well , before we started now , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to provide all the people in this audience in this audience to provide an all inclusive advice to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them , and after that , i &apos;m going to ask them to clap , when you &apos;re willing to accept gary &apos;s offering .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to accept gary &apos;s offer .
are that all ?f this ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
they knew , it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for that journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact that she &apos;s looking at objectively for the first time more information than the second time , but i would like to reach it that they felt real .
because the images made it feel really for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the concretization .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities to understand that the consequences are associated with the individuals , and that these consequences have to be feeling ve
why do people give average 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ecc map or a credit card than bargetden ?
because it &apos;s not we really feeling money .
and it turns out that if you manage that something feels concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i did with shlomo benarti and alessandro previtter , we &apos;ve done a study with people -- employees that all have worked for -- and these people were all in a 
and during that convention , we &apos;ve leaved this convention as it was always , we just added a little bit .
the little that we &apos;ve been doing is that we have asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money .
where we were doing this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save , or a rise to four percent of th
the third technology : categorization .
we can do better with more categories than with more choices .
for example , here &apos;s a study that we &apos;ve done in a magazine .
it turns out that it &apos;s up to the wegan supermarkets up and down in the northeast , the number of 313 different kinds of magazines has up to 664 mewsages .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 mewsages , and i show it into 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and then you give you more choices , then you &apos;ve given you more choice and give you a better choic
because the categories tell me how i can hold it apart .
here &apos;s two different jewelries .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
if you think the left display is swing , and the ad right is jazz , then you clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right , you &apos;re going to clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the on the right is swin , but you know what ?
this is a highly useful categorization process .
the categories need to say something , not who provides the choice .
and that problem is often , if you look at the long lists of all these funds .
who do you really want to inform with it ?
my fourth technology : prediction for complexity .
it turns out we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the buy of a car .
here &apos;s a german writer who provides you the opportunity to configurate your car .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car .
now these decisions in the number of choices they offer per decision .
cars , the outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , driven -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order where the choices appear .
half of the customers are going from the many possibilities , 56 car colors to the low possibilities , four graves .
the other half of the clients goes from the low possibilities , four grives , the 56 colors , many opportunities .
what do i look at ?
how interests they are .
if you use the standard choice in the decision , that means that they &apos;re changed , the hotter , i &apos;ll lose it .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people who go from many to the low choices , and over and over again , the standard choice .
we lose them .
let &apos;s go from the little choices to many , then they stick there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is change the order that this information is presented .
when i start with the simple start , i learn how i choose .
even though the gravity chooses , nothing about my preferences in the interior care , it &apos;s still providing me to choose .
it also gives me in excitement about the great product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate me to motivate with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of decision-making -- restrict -- they &apos;re going to concrete the overlooking alternatives , concrete -- we can deal with more categori
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage them the opportunities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people they &apos;r
because i believe that the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in the choice .
and the more we &apos;re choiceng , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of decision-making .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin alloca , trend manager in youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video is going to become viral , and then we want to talk about why that &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so infinitely difficult .
but web videos allows that we all , or all of our creative activities can be famous famous in one part of the world &apos;s culture .
every single one of you could be famous to the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video got up in the minute .
again , a tiny percentage ever becomes viral , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times and so the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : testemakers , participation communities and the unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
what !
hhhh , wow .
last year , bear vasques sent this video that he filmed in front of his house in the yosemet national park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer for the first time .
actually , bear &apos;s video didn &apos;t want to do viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re meaning yosemite mountain bear .
he had gotten a lot of nature videos .
and this video was actually been sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jummy .
jimmy was sending the tweet that made the video last so popular .
because the testemakers like jimmy kill , imagine new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the week , weight . friday , friday , &quot; down on friday . you wouldn &apos;t have thought we would lead this entertainment witho
rebecca blacks : one of the popular things is one of the popular bills of the year .
it &apos;s been almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it doesn &apos;t seem to be anything .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , which is .
if you want to know , these other spikes are also friday .
but what about that day , this particular friday ?
well , toshhi gave it up . many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was a first one that made a joke in twitter about it .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or group of tastemakers were taking a standpoint with a large audience , and speed up the process .
and then this community of people who shared this great individual , and started talking about it and play with it .
now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single week .
unlike the united entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading or something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
it became almost 50 million times this year .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats to look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that &apos;s doing in the internet culture of technology and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an ancient version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix community shot from the ground that made from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate .
today , we don &apos;t just find anything to something , we &apos;re doing .
who could have predicted this ?
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow , &quot; or nyan cat , &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; or &quot; nyan cat &quot; o
what three books could have write their writing something like this ?
in a world where every minute of the time is going to upload video , just really unique and unexpected like the mentioned videos .
i give , i wasn &apos;t very interested in me when a friend said , i should look at this great video about a guy who protested in new york in new york for bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not driving on the way , but often there are disabilities that aren &apos;t recently driving .
because that was completely surprising and humorous , casey was neither &apos;s funny idea and his argument for five million times .
this approach comes for everything that we &apos;re doing is creative .
and that &apos;s all leading us to the great question ...
what does that mean ?
hhhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemakers , creative participants , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody determines access and where the audience determines popularity .
as i said , one of the greatest stars -- justin beeber -- made his beginning on youtube .
no one has to give your ideas green light .
and today we all feel as owners of our pop culture .
and that &apos;s not the features of the old media , and they &apos;re also little to the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i go together in 10 minutes about the connection between women around three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connection is in the life of a four-year-old girl , and never d
the story is not over .
she &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his lifetime .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home was held together .
hold it into the introduction of the communists in saigon in front of the eyes , as he needs to stand up that his life has been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , were sticking with his now .
he moved into the silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother has never forgotten about his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story tried to crush us , we &apos;ve been observing .
the next puzzle shows what a boat in the early morning rod looks like on the early morning .
my mother was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , life had been asking her : the flight of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely exclusive that it could fail .
after a four-year-old and film reef saga , there &apos;s a boat silent on the lake , as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risk .
they had the biggest fear from pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was a little point on the boat .
in a prisoner , my sister and i , then were drinking themselves and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the strange tucker of the engine , the clapping of any wave on the bug , the far and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came a lot of times , but let &apos;s develop from the death of the men on our boat , or the following of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start six hours
but i remember the lights of the oil platform from the malaysic coast , and the young man who broke together and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple
no apple has ever tasted .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbournes .
and the next puzzle that is about four women in three generations that are together to build a new life .
we let us down in footscary , one of the working class , which is the population of immigrant layers .
in other things that were in the old-class locations that existence was completely unknown , there was no consideration that was completely unknown .
the smells come from the leaders came from the rest of the world .
and the final broken english had been exchanged between people who had one thing in common : they started .
my mother was working on the farms , then on a flash band in a car factory , six days , double layers .
it &apos;s kind of getting the time to get english and and qualifications .
we were poor .
each dollar has been shared , and i was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do this , mostly the new thing that came from the second hand .
two couples for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a school unform until the knocks , because she had to do six years .
and there were the rarely painful choires of &quot; slick eyes , &quot; and here and there waste , &quot; asians , goes home . &quot;
home where ?
something disturbed in me .
there was a meeting for reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sleep in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job , every night , until their nights came so that i could wake it up .
she opened a computer business , then made a cosmetic education and opened one business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t get the change , angry and inflexible , and worried children , captured between two worlds .
learning and sponsors were looked .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one was , i was the classic asian student , which asked incredible demands on himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in unsecure lifes , the tragic stories of violence , drugs and the isolation .
but so many people helped over the years .
and because of that help , i &apos;ve been selected in my last year of juartism as a young australian of the year .
and i was going from a puzzle to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymic residents from footral , was now tan , refugees and social activist that was invited to talks in places that never heard of , and how their existence their existence you could neve
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the tage .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the passe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the context of the life of the unknown suburbance -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who would tell each other the stories of their day and include 
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she remembered me that i was so old as we were doing the boat .
no , no opportunity was never .
&quot; do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about young unemployment and education , and the neglection of the marginalized and discovered .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all lifetimes , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t do with a career in jura .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a new commitment , new in the image -- and not only , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
because it can lead to the collapse of the horizon , it can mean so easy to accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my competitive area to know that yeah , the world , but not just how to fear it .
opportunities that wouldn &apos;t have been encouraged .
there was an energy , an incredible optimism , a strange mixture of the humble and the disk .
so i followed my feeling .
and i collected a little team of people around me , for the debt , &quot; doesn &apos;t get an incredible challenge .
one year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of every day , i cooked a huge potal soup that we shared .
we were working until late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant things , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the united states .
after a trip there .
my feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure went forward .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time in confucianism , the social norma and the local mandarin was the most important person .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died soon after your birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a mandar , whose mother became them .
without supporting her man &apos;s worried , she worried them for a sense by bringing him in front of the court and in their own case , and an even larger sensory than she won .
&quot; doesn &apos;t go up to yourself . &quot;
i &apos;ve just picked up in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the pinches , and looked at them on the other side .
i knew she &apos;d come to pass themselves .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in footscare and sat around their saring .
we told their stories , and we assured that we were still with them .
and the middlight came to the monk and said he has to close the surgery .
my mother asked us to fit your hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding you for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them . &quot;
if our family , if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through women .
if you look at who we were , and how life shaped us , we can see that the men who might have come in our lives we would have come into the cross .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think of the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privileges , before lighting , from embarrassment .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave , the uncomfortable , stick duckers of the motor , the further horizon , who didn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and bring them safe , i would do it .
also , tan &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or five series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because , of course , that &apos;s a picture you can &apos;t record with your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography started when i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 years .
i combined it with my former preferences for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera was rather in planning .
and when you take a picture with a camera , ends the process when you press on the trigger .
so for me , in photography seemed to be more likely to be more about being at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody can do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process begins when the trigger is pressed .
photos like this : a construction site along a much danger street .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and yet a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and colorful , but all of the common goals to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really catch , but i &apos;d like to let it look like this , on a photo .
photos where you have to think a little moment in order to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more really about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the end , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i look at them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfect imaginable physical objects that we &apos;re all identifying with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional than it might exist .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re listing our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture of realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , things around us in our everyday life .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because they &apos;re just seeing the wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow a realistic result .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but combines something special as this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photographs have the same illumination .
and these two pictures are fulfilling these two demands -- from the same high and the same lighting thing .
thirdly , it &apos;s impossible to distinguish where the individuals are starting and ending by connecting them unleashes .
it makes it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast and limbiness to the edges of the single images , photographic lacks , how fields , colored colors and disorders , we &apos;re going to look like the boundaries betwee
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom is part .
this picture is actually completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely complete
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to take compromises with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been recorded on an angerous flight .
this is from another place .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
and , you know , i even killed the house up on the island on the island to make it look swedish .
to achieve a realistic result , it goes out of myself on planning .
i &apos;m always starting with a sketh , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s each piece very well .
and if you make good recordings , the result can be pretty beautiful and pretty realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that limites us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects are failing .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced at the radboud university was to do a major listener .
and she doesn &apos;t get particularly scientific -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how does it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems that all -- maybe most of the electronic health projects failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my wina car . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button , one .
and every morning i &apos;ll jump on it .
and yeah , i have a task as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve been setting my task at 95 percent .
it works very simple : every time i jump on the car , she &apos;s also sending my data in google health .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re also calling out of my device so you can see where my weight problem is , not just in the moment when i need cardiological support or so , but with a look at the
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 flowers on twitter .
so every morning i &apos;m jumping on my wolan scale , and people talk to me , before i &apos;m in the car sit , &quot; lunch longer just a little salad today , lucia . &quot;
but that &apos;s the nice thing that can happen because it &apos;s the group process , groups force to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used to smoke .
but it could be used to get people from their chairs , and get them to play any kind of game to control their health better .
next week , that &apos;s on the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little blood pressure that you &apos;re looking at an iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure their blood pressure , sending it to their doctors and share it to others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients come into the game . they can not only take control of control , being captains on their own ship , but also can help the cost of the health challenge , double demand , 
make methods that are easy to use and begin with this one to embrace patients in the team .
and that &apos;s what they can do through these methods , but also through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a short video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all of the monitoriats are around mastery .
we know another one where all the dan stations are .
and clearly , we can find fast food chain .
but where would the next add to help this patient ?
we asked around , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving add was at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website and asked a cass mass , &quot; if you see an ade , please share us where he is when he &apos;s going , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business , of cou
and over 10,000 aeds were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
and we &apos;ve designed an ipad app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layan , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like mastright and someone can use together , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , your microsoft cell phone to find the next aed that can save life .
and today , we don &apos;t want to just want to take this as aedeu , as the product calls , but introduce as an aedus .
and we want to bring this into a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , of other universities , around helping us behave like node points to behave these aeeds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in holidays , and somebody &apos;s going together , you can find your own relationship or somebody else , you can find this aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us to confirm these aeds .
these could be curier services , or technicians , for example , just to make sure that the participated ade is still at their place .
please help us , and try to improve the health of not just something , but take into your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little startup wants us to force ourselves by forcing ourselves by getting it .
it &apos;s about the crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it &apos;s perhaps before it &apos;s headed .
well , we can just surprise that -- i &apos;m just going to jump the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in an environment that is pretty everything they hate , we &apos;ve worked in the governmen
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like peace scorps for computer feaks .
we elect some fellows every year , and we &apos;re working on with cities .
instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re going to send them into the third world .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what you really do is to show what technology is possible today .
so they &apos;re making all .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
and here it looks like searching for a data , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who &apos;s freezing him , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good in bhe brand fight when he &ap
how did he be looking for this particular way of looking for help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , the code for america &apos;s code for america .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s been a lot of fabruary last february .
and they realized that the city never breaks these hydratts .
but a particular fellow , a man named errich michaels &apos;s ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were struggling with the sidewalks , directly in front of these .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a hydrant .
you &apos;re trying to close to him when it &apos;s sustained .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first one .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows have written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do another government technology .
it spreads rasically .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but so the citizens to adopt tsunami sires .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app , to get the citizens to clean the classed gulles .
and chicago has just introduced her so that people who have the business dries when it &apos;s sustaing .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it &apos;s friendly spread , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you don &apos;t normally know it &apos;s not like that .
the software is going to take a few years in the rule .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston for the three people two and a half months .
it was about a method with parents that are the right public schools for their children .
we were told later that if it would go over the normal channels , it took over two years , and it cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s now a project in the californian justice that the taxpayers have been two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on each level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then spreads from themselves , is a kind of shot in front of the government &apos;s institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- no longer like a private business , how many people think it should .
and not even like a technology company , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation , which takes the problem of the government -- not as the problem of collective institution , but as a problem of collective ac
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who manufacture the tools that we need to make things effectively in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that go up and write government apps , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all your feelings about politics and the snakes to work , and all the other things we &apos;re really exciting about is government , in the core , in the words of 
today , a lot of people have given up government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , ask you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately creates their power from us -- remember the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how that change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought that the government is probably about people to choose .
now after two years , i came to conclusion that it &apos;s particularly communities to go .
this is the call center for service and information .
that &apos;s where you come out in your city 111 .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- actually , they all do -- you &apos;ll see that people who call governm
so scott gets this call .
he tips &quot; the journal &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s starting with the animal catcher .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if that &apos;s looking down ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the journals .
boston has not just a call center .
it has an app , a web and cell phone called &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is very smart people in the office of the new urban mechanics office in boston .
one day -- that &apos;s an actual report -- came in , &quot; my taste in my garbage . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what &apos;s happening to &quot; citics connect &quot; is different .
scott is talking about human to human .
but on citizen connect , it &apos;s all public so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next thing we got , &quot; i went over there , &quot; i found the waste town behind the house .
contribution ? yes . alive ? yeah .
turned on the page . went home .
good night , sweet concrete . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help himself and to help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role .
she connected these two people .
and you could have connected them with state performances if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
if an neighbor of the other , we strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call the animals , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it is that government is not the same politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one &apos;s the input of the other .
that our contributions to the system is choosing .
how often we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we return , and we expect that the government reflects our values
that &apos;s because the government is like an ocean , and politics are the top of the 1950s .
and what &apos;s below underneath is what we call bureaucraci .
and we &apos;re using this word with such conservation .
but it &apos;s this condition that we own , and for what we pay for , which is working against us , something else , and then we took ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government is going on .
we need to get into the machinery of government .
so the occupy hesia movement has done .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of worried citizens that has written a very detailed 325-page report , which is an answer to the sec memo above the financial reform .
that &apos;s not politically active , that &apos;s active .
now , for those of us who gave up government , it &apos;s time that we want to think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we need to achieve without improving an institution that can act in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it must become efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to transform the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something that can actually reach the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build only really systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with seeing their voice for granted .
they don &apos;t fight this struggle that we &apos;re all fighting around , who can talk ; you &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you can except their opinion , on every channel at any time , and they &apos;re doing it .
so , if you &apos;re confronted with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care about using their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improves the work of the government .
and these apps lets us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a hydratton to get out of the hydrates , trying to have a waste picket with a rate with a rate .
and surely , we &apos;d have these hydrants all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government that pay and receive performances .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i have for you all here : when it goes around the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a l
thank you .
normally , my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are out , and i thought , because i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what &apos;s going on , with thes
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... could you please show the slide .
this is a slide that i happened to chose from my order .
i &apos;m not about the details of the slide , but rather than the general shape .
this slide shows an analysis of the performance of risk processors compared to the performance of a local area network .
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some other things , which we often meet in our field , some kind of just on a semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is actually a power in the performance scale .
and this is a note that we have to use this guy scale to semi-logarithmic curves in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so if you could please take the light back .
a little bit bright because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology of semi-logarithmic curves ?
and the reason is , if i draw it into a normal curve , where , say , that &apos;s the years , so this is an ancient mass of the technology that i want to present with a graph , then the graph will b
and then they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , that would be very distributed on the semi-logarithmic scale , very unreasible , in the form of a flat line
but when this happens like this , then this changes the qualitative conditions .
so if the transportation technology would progress so fast as the microprocessor technology , we could increase in a taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
this was never before in the history of technology , this kind of recursive growth through which scale scale is exponentially increasing every few years .
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you see they &apos;re not going to go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything evolves forever and forever as quickly as now .
there are two options .
either , it &apos;s going to be a classic structure like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen .
that &apos;s something .
well , i &apos;m optimist , so i think it &apos;s going to happen in the way here .
it &apos;s really like that , that means we &apos;re here right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the bitter world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to do and i &apos;m often asking myself , is this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that the world takes slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere at the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you find that the future still lies at 2000 .
that &apos;s not that we &apos;re going to go .
so in other words , the future has been scrubbed by a year since i was in this world .
and i think the reason is that we realize that something &apos;s going on .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that right now , there &apos;s no sense to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different that a simple high school of what we do now do not make sense 
so i &apos;d like to talk about what this might be , this transition we &apos;re right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go back a step back and look at this thing on a long time sale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at this on the timescale of the earth &apos;s life .
i think the entire picture makes sense , if you split it into some billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , sterile stone line with many of them floating chemicals .
so if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , that gives us a pretty good image about how they did .
and i think there are theories that start understanding how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of which is that at that time , little oil spills wer
some of these oil droplets had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and growing it to grow .
everybody who were like this , started to give up .
these little oil droplets were in the sense the most primitive cell form .
however , these oil spills weren &apos;t about alive in today &apos;s sense , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , they have distributed chemicals into unequal amounts .
so every dropping was a little bit different .
in fact , the drugs grew up , which one for the growth of optimilar composition had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
and so these tended to survive longer , and they were restructing in bigger .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interestingly it gets when these droples learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , these droples have learned the ability to drop information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the cell as an information , and in a certain chemical shape , which we call dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found a way in this mindless , evolutionary way that allowed them to write what they were made of , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is to store over the time of 2.5 billion years where they created , and that &apos;s the same thing .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly same code and the same writing .
and every creature uses the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re like that we &apos;re just for the pleasure purpose of writing itself in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micrograms of a white powder that i &apos;ve been trying to keep in airports from security .
and it &apos;s -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is from normal letters that we &apos;re using to symbolize -- and i wrote my visit map on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written 10 time
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my visits card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have really been a selfish , then i would have written them on a virus and give them up in the space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna was an interesting step .
and that passed these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting step happened where things were completely different , and these cells started to communicate and exchange information that communities come from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you already knew this , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , growing the constitution to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how they can keep penicillin and wrote this information with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because t
this communication now allowed the reasons of communities that were in some sense , they were synergetic .
so they have either survived , or they went together , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more often repeated and preferred by evolution .
the transition is there where these communities broke so close together that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community into the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have multicellular communities , communities of many different cell types , which are functioning together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multi-cell community .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer asked on yourself .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started developing , so that the level that evolution was , no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organisms .
the next step happened within these communities .
the cells started abstracting information again .
and they developed particular structures that didn &apos;t do anything else than processing information within organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing that these cells have built .
they started training specialists within the community , particular structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and sticking from information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that time , an individual -- now learning is happening within a single organism in the lifespan of a single organism instead of these evolutionary time .
so one organism could learn for example , not eating a certain fruit because she tasted bad and made him sick , the last time he eated her .
this could now happen within the lifespan of an individual lifestyle , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned about the individuals that died because of 
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with these particular information structures , because evolution could now happen within an individual .
she could take place within a time-learning .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the most refined us version of this communication is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated here , really complicated and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and give basically basically basic sounds of me , where hope to create an idea of creating ideas in your head that has a certain kind of similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , transform it in sounds , a sequence of sounds , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we , humanity , is we started abstracting .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that have been through the multi-cellorganisms -- the abstraction of our methods that we consider data .
the invention of the language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
telephone , computers , video bands , cd romes , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to have this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s abso able to evolve faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
you also saw the small evolution of where he showed a little evolution in &quot; convolution &quot; program , directly in front of your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve got the time calls again .
the first steps i told you , they took a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , some hundred million years .
then the next step , like language and so on , less than one million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
the process feeds off themselves and becomes , i think , catalytical is the word for -- when something increases his change speed .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
we see the process that feeds of itself .
i live professionally from computers , and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using computers without the recent progress in computing technology .
my recent activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what makes every single transistor in the connection machine .
it has billions of them .
what i &apos;m doing instead , and whatever the designers of thinking machines are doing , we think on a certain abstraction level , the machine is doing something that &apos;s overwhelming , better
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand really .
a method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and that i &apos;ve been using in the last time is evolution itself .
and we &apos;re installing an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond .
in order to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generate a hundred million accidental sequences of instructions .
now , all of these randomly elected instructions are leading , all the programs , and choose the people who are the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for it .
so find programs that can be sort of the most east numbers .
of course , the opportunity in randomly elected instructions is very small , that they &apos;re accidental to sort numbers , so none of the instructions are actually doing this .
but one of them may with some happiness with two numbers into the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , now take these 10 percent of the sequences that are the next one .
memory these , delete the rest .
now reproduces all of the rest that the numbers were best .
and with a method of recording , analog for reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they &apos;re producing kids through the exchange of their suburituins , and the children drive the features of the sub-routines from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that came together something closer than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
govern them again .
maybe some mutations lead .
and that &apos;s another generation with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through an evolution for millions of years in the computer within less minutes , or in more complicated cases , a few hours .
and finally , i get programs that the numbers can sort .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i &apos;d ever write from hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
i tried to understand it .
it &apos;s contract and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that you &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
and i sat in a 777 with marvin minsky , and he walked a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , this airplane is hundreds of thousands of small parts that work together to make their flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t that make you more confident ? &quot;
we know that a development process is not optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers , for a process that &apos;s different from classical engineering engineering .
it allows us to produce things with a much higher complexity than they would allow the normal methods .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the opportunities yet .
so , in some sense , the technology is flowing .
we use these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these processes even faster .
so there &apos;s a feedback .
it becomes faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies from themselves feed by themselves .
we &apos;re doing down .
we &apos;ve been at a point where the analog is at the time , as an individual organism has developed to multicell organisms .
so we &apos;re the open , and we can &apos;t do that , which the hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
but i really believe that after us get something else .
i think it &apos;s very highly to say that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
well lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m listening here , before i &apos;m still elected .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was underneath the starling sky in the desert with supi singer mukhitiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the ancient indian epos since the ancient indian epos , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in the time , we jumped into a car and switches across the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do that with airplanes .
at that time , when the great indian warrior prince had listen to the time , he took one bow , shot in the ground and water .
now we &apos;re going to do this with drillers and machines .
we came up with the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got something scared of technology .
i made me fear that i could lose the ability to lose the sunset without camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not killing magic .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magic thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world of pirates and sophisticated ships and images in my idea .
i came up with this like our sending clocks and cameras were dreaming about it .
they stopped being inspired by this .
and so i got into the world of technology to see how i could use them magic instead of killing magic .
at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling readers around the world .
it can know how we think .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and texts , animation , sound and touch .
the storytelling needs more and more senses .
but what do we do this ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so this is , &quot; this box says , &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
and it &apos;s going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps who i live -- that &apos;s really addressed .
the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean that magicians and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found always exciting .
that &apos;s how you &apos;ve got to keep the ipad kipping out the fireflies .
and they light up through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated with me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can put in a single multer .
and that &apos;s why every book here , and each world will be a little muttle that i &apos;m going here in the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books had always maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and glows and serves to orientation in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also showing other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
and also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that indian is also very time .
these are the aspaas .
we &apos;ve heard all of the feel and nymphens , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the asparas ?
the poor asparas were caught in indras thousands of years in an old moving book .
and we bring them back in a contemporary story for children .
a story that &apos;s going on with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
the theme environmental crisis , a big problem over the last 10 years is that kids sit in their rooms , their computers without going out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;ll send on a search . you have to go out and collect the ipad &apos;s picture of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , stones , pills and clams .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this childhood ritual is brought back . you &apos;ve got to go out to make a picture of a flower .
in another chapter , you &apos;ve got to photograph a piece of trees into the chapter .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos you can then put online online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fine , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a foot . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
and that makes some kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you &apos;ve actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan an interaction where you use the video of the ipad , and through augmented reality , which is an animation of equipment that appears on a plant in front of the house .
on a place , the screen is filling with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the wind , they &apos;re blowing away and read the rest of the book .
we all move into a world where the natural forces of technology come closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and us closer to the natural world and on the magic , fun , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in exploration , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the social weakers in the social buildings and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
here at ted , to see and listen to how stimulating that is , has given a lot of power to me .
in the short time here , i realized : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and force that it didn &apos;t .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s meaning , but the words of an engaged teacher &apos;s particularly meaningful .
as a doctor you can do good . as a careful doctor , but you can do even more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became large in a family , a traditional african american household that was dominated by a matriarch , and this matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a methon , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in each family .
she was also the starting point of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in virginia as slaves in the 1840s .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed her world is very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little young boy , she came up to me and gained me .
she pushed me so fight that i couldn &apos;t breathe , and then she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up with me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no . &quot; she marmed me . when i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; she said to me . &quot;
it was something that did something that you wanted to be close to your close .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of your ten children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins all around .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins would walk around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and started .
first , i thought this was a game .
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this went up about 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came over to me . she took me at me , and she said , &quot; come , bryan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember that it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise you &apos;re not talking about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , oma .
she said , &quot; honor word ? &quot; i said , &quot; oh . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to look at you . she said , &quot; i want you to see you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special .
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , bryan .
i said , &quot; ok , oma .
she said , &quot; well , first promise me you &apos;ll always love your moma . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise you &apos;re always going to care about them . &quot;
i took my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
and then she said , &quot; next , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing : &quot; even though it &apos;s difficult to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; well , oma . i promise it . &quot;
after all , she said , &quot; the last thing you promise me is &quot; that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; oh , oma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year of younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixpack beer with my sister and me and went to the forest .
we were just alivering there as well as well .
and then he took a block of beer and bottom of my sister , and she took , and then they offered me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . no . just do i don &apos;t want any beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to do that today , you also do everything we &apos;re doing .
i had what , your sister had what . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just make you . &quot;
my brother started me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now drink with you . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t still make you crazy because of oma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you talk about ?
he said , &quot; orama is telling all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed .
i &apos;m going to stand you something .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is maybe publicly transmitted .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s virtue . i say that because it means because identity means .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us , that they can &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all of their grandmothers , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the prosthtion in prison .
my uncles died of alcoholenculus diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we needed to take .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in destination and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest incarceration rates in the world .
seven million people released to disagreement or with conditional stream .
in my opinion , mass incasions have changed our world .
in social weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one out of three male blacks between 18 and 30 is happiness , in prison , released or with condition .
in urban communities , everywhere in the country -- los angeles about philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men here either in prison , in prison , or with conditio
but our system is not only being shaped by questions that have race attention , it &apos;s going to develop through poverty .
we have a justice system that she &apos;s much better treating much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , it affects the results .
and yet we seem to be satisfied .
a politics of fear and the ground has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some highly interesting developments .
my home state of alabama delivers you the right when you &apos;re continuously convicted .
here , and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population has lost their electricity .
we predict that in 10 years , the question of the recognition of the civil honor rights is going to be as high as the prospective of the selection law .
the silence is silence .
i &apos;m going to give children .
a lot of my manders are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that convicted three-year-old children death in prison .
in this one of our country , there are children &apos;s living sentences without condition .
we already have a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i put people in death cells .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe , because it taught us because the real question is : does a human being earned to die for one of him ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other sense is not , has somebody made death for a crime , but , have we deserved to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america defines through error .
in nine people we &apos;ve encountered , one that we &apos;ve found for innocent , which was leaved and left out of the death .
an amazing mistake . one in nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never get somebody with an airplane when for nine airplanes that are dropping out one .
but somehow we &apos;re going to create this problem with this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach african-american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time against the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about that .
but for the african americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be scared of lynchobos .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
and these older people come to me now and say , &quot; me , stevenson , you &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re going to say that we &apos;re going to stop to say that we &apos;
they say , &quot; no , say people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the race separation and decades of the racistic motivated support and apartheis .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand the meaning of our data in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly constantly constantly .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to close to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the race of race without the willingness is true and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany across the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply distribution to hear them talk . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death sentence .
and of course , they never give them in germany .
it &apos;s been very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever going to talk again for the systematic kills of people .
it would be conscious about us , aware of us , consciously , and people &apos;s consciousness .
i thought about it .
how it would feel like to live in a world where the german state left people , especially when it would be a lot of jews .
it would be unbearable .
it would be conscious .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we set up people -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted of death , when it &apos;s black -- in the same states , where the earth i
and yet , there &apos;s this mental application .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult topics , the positives and wonderful things are affected with .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities are overlated by suffering , abuse , devastation , excitement .
i &apos;m important to unite both .
because ultimately , we &apos;re talking about what we need more hope , more engagement , more commitments to make in a complex world .
for me , the time means to bring thinking and talking about the poor that are never going to be at ted .
but think about a way that &apos;s integrated in our own life .
we all need to believe in the end of things that we can &apos;t see .
we &apos;re doing this . so rational we are , so much we estimate intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not only coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by persuasion in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head connection that i believe is driving us , not only for all the lights and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
vallav havel , the great chechcal politician , once said .
when we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to be all kinds of things , but what we needed most was hopeful , a mental orientation , the willingness , sometimes to be 
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe that the ted communities have to engage .
there &apos;s no distriction about technology and design that allows us to be and human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , excitement and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i had the great privilege of meeting pina parks .
woman parks came back to montogemy , where she met two of their oldest friends , these older women , johnny car , who organized the montogemy busboxyto -- an incredible african american -- and virgi
so these women met and talked about it .
and then went to the city , and he said , &quot; bran , woman parks to the city . we want to talk about .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listened to .
it was always inspiring , so finishing .
and one day i sat there , and after a few hours , woman parks turned to me about us , &quot; now bryan , tell me what &apos;s the unitiative for the same thing .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do against injustice .
we want to help people who were innocently convicted .
we want to fight breakdown and discrimination in the strining system .
we want to create life-life sentences without conditional conditions for children .
we want to do something against the death penalth .
we want to get the number of peers .
we want to create mass infacts .
i thought my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and then she said , &quot; mmmh . mmm . mmm .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman car standed before to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; well , therefore you have to be very , very picker . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i believe that the ted community should be cheater .
we need to find ways to put these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst things that we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s going to get every person on the planet .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
when somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a person .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that , although it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring , and so exciting , we don &apos;t end up with our technology , not on the things that we develop , not on our intellect a
eventually , a society will not measure how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they treat with the poor , the convictions that are increasing .
because in this context , we &apos;re first starting to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose the balance . it &apos;s a story to the end .
sometimes i get too much .
i &apos;m going to tire how we all all .
sometimes these ideas of our thinking are thinking about in a very important way .
i gave these children who were convicted to very hard sentences .
i go to the investigation prison and visit a mandant that may be 13 or 14 years old , and which is as adults as an adult .
then i ask myself , how could that happen ?
how can a judge somebody turn somebody into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at it as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my gods , if a judge can transform us to something else , then he has to have magic forces .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
you should also be what they wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think about right , i started working on a contribution .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys as a mandand .
and i started with this position . the overcome said , &quot; contribution , my poor , 14-year-old black mandands like a privileged , white , 75 year-old top manager . &quot;
and in my response , i explained that missing behaviors of the state and the police and the process and the process of the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , nothing more right is that there &apos;s just missing .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know whether i &apos;d been dreaming this crazy , or written him .
and to my description , i had not only written him , but sent to the court .
a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to talk in the court and this crazy case .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i drove to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went from my car and went up the stairs up .
when i walked up the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the people in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyers ? &quot; and i said , &quot; yeah .
he came up with me and engineered me .
and he then whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
and i have to say it gave me force .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute something to a community , a perspective of hope .
well , i entered the court .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , have you asked this crazy assignment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; oh , &quot; and then we started discussing .
and more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and depressing states and office workers .
it was the courage of the course of people who were angry that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye angle , i saw the jastor and go .
he always looked back through the window , and he could hear the whole touhadh hearing .
he went up and down .
eventually , this older black man came with a very worried facial expression in the local room and put directly behind me , almost to the defense bank .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
and during the break , a police barrier came in which it turned out that the janitor was in the court .
this deput ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the right hall ?
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m come to say that young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral community of the universe has sweet down , but that &apos;s the justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as human rights , as long as we care about human rights and basic values .
that our survival is linked to survival every single one .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design for entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to see those of you who see that , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have seen an obvious wish , this community , and heard them and help them do something and doing something .
what can we do ?
bray stevenson : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a people &apos;s spring in this spring , where it &apos;s actually about companies to do something from the money that flows into the politics of punishment
here , in california , for example , you &apos;ll spend a billion dollars for the next five years , a billion dollars for the next five years .
and yet , 46 percent of the killing delices didn &apos;t do with an arrastment .
56 percent of the rape cases don &apos;t come in front of the court .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this reference is going to suggest that money into more security forces and security .
i think everywhere are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate in america is always down .
this fact is often asked in a relationship with the increased increased numbers .
what would you tell someone who believed it ?
well , in fact , the number of violence crimes haven &apos;t really changed .
most of the massive inhabitations in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of violence .
it was the miscuited production against drugs .
and that &apos;s why the dramatic high pays come in the prison sites .
we &apos;ve been surrounding ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we &apos;ve got three services &quot; laws that people bring people forever behind grids , for a bicycle theft , for the theft of the theft , instead of giving them back to the victims .
i think we have to do more to help people who &apos;ve become victims of the design , not less .
and i don &apos;t believe that our consistential philosophy is not helping .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you &apos;ve really brought a string here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden death , brings an increased danger risk .
speaker 2 : famine in somalia . speak three : peer spray of the police .
talking about 4 : dingerous cartels . speak five : dangerous crossing ships .
speaker 6 : social decline . speaker 7 : 75 deaths .
there &apos;s 8 : tunamic warning . speaker 9 : cyber attacks .
different speakers : drug wars . mass destruction . tornado .
recession . standard . doom . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days . or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects , because our minds give exactly these subjects .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because nothing is more important than ourselves , the first supplies for all the information is part of our temporal lobes , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our danger detector .
it sorts off , and throughout the information on the search for every difference of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; when it &apos;s blood , the demand is really true .
well , with all of our digital devices , which us seven days a week , the week of these negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but potentially , that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it &apos;s going to be possible for us to create a world of surplus .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , water and energy problems -- we have .
and as human beings , we &apos;re much better at predicting problems in very long term , but they &apos;re eventually overcoming .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century so that we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled to the inflation of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has reduced by a tenth .
and that &apos;s that the nutrition , electricity transportation and communication costs have reduced a multiple .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re now living in a very peaceful time of human history .
and according to charles kenya , the alphabetization rate in the last 130 years , 20 percent goes to 80 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we raise our expectations constantly .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
remember , a great percentage of americans who live under the poverty limit , access to electricity , waters , toilets , televisions , televisions , conditioning and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the imperators of the earth would never have dreamed like luxury goods .
the basis for many of them form technologies , and these grows expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to be information technology in the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the price performance quality doubles all 12 to 24 month
that &apos;s why the cell phone in your pocket is a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands of thousands of faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it goes -- in good like in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and up .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic location on the left , she &apos;s going to go up .
so the growth rate itself accelerates .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends at autodesk call &quot; infinite computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , synthetic biology , fuels , digital medicine , nano-mate
how many of you have seen the victory of ibms supercomputer watson at risk ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve gone through the newspapers and looked for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this , &quot; watson &apos;s human applience . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of a mobile phone is available .
four years ago , ray kurzweil started , and i here at ted is a new university that &apos;s called singularity .
we bring our students all these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services that can influence the lives of billions of people in a decade .
think about it , a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can provide the dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
when i think about creating surplus , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating surplus of goods .
and scarcity is context , and technology is a resource of liberating power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napaleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silver beds , napoleons themselves got gold passes .
the king of siam started getting aluminum .
aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet , valuable than gold and plate .
this is why the dome of the washington monuments had been made from aluminum .
although aluminum takes 8.3 percent of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come from pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicate .
but then the technology of electrolysies were developed and made aluminum manufacturing so cheap that we &apos;re using it with our disposable mentality .
and then let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet that &apos;s filled with 5,000 times more energy than we use in any year .
16 tearatts of energy , all eight minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , the cost of solar streams in india to reduce 50 percent of the dial stream -- 88 rupees in comparison to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy was 50 percent last year .
last month , it &apos;s published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the united states , six cents per who , compared to six cents per who , compared to 15 cents in the nat
and if we have an energy survey , we &apos;ll also have water in the surface .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember , as carl sagan , the voyager spacecraft in 1990 , when it pulled on saturn , turned back towards earth ?
he took a famous picture . how did it mean ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet which is 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent saltwater , two percent are united , and we &apos;re fighting around 50 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
these are new nanotechnologies on the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of the iot of the yoursolf , i want to share with you -- he gave me a permission -- his technology that &apos;s called &q
it can create a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all of that for less than two cents per day .
the head of coca-cola has just been involved to start a big test project with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything is good , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola is going to apply this technology global in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology supported innovation that is today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent discovery rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just remember that a massai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication as president reagan 25 years ago .
and when you search with your smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world that has information and communications , as no one had ever predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousands of dollars -- gps , the video and photos , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics --
and the best thing is potentially what expects us in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure to announce the so-called &quot; 10 million qualtom tricordr x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all these technologies to each other into a cell phone that you can talk to the device because it &apos;s car excited , you can test its blood ve
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnostic than a team of highly sualified doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease load and 1.3 percent of the collaborators of health care .
if this device sequences a rana or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s going to get the health and prevents a pandemic in front of their outbreak .
but now the biggest power that will lead us to a world of surplus .
i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are standing for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 70 billion brands .
and just by the way , the largest interaction against a population explosion is a better education and diet all over the world .
in 2010 , we had online under two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re previously two on five billion internet users .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before , are going to connect to the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
and instead of economic graduation , i see one of the greatest economic addictions of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier through the use of the tricoder , and they become better trained by the khan academy , and that they will have the opportunity to use 3d printers and &quo
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of human community bring us us ?
how about a sentence , never before .
how about whatever you are , wherever you are , to give a voice to make it attention and create change , for the very first time ?
what will these three billion people are bringing ?
how about contributions that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned in through the x prizes is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus , things that great companies and governments could only create in the 
i want to conclude with a story that really excited me .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
it &apos;s a game called the fold .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
the after his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors , etc .
and they &apos;re now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern recognition better than folds the proteins than the best supercomputers .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best protein order of the world , this was not a mit professor , somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked day as an assistant 
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we &apos;ve got more than individuals today to provide the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropis .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something against a change piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medicine , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in business that i can allow me to give up a piece of my own wrong prestige to enable this .
but before i come to the actual subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the seasonal close and we &apos;re moving to the world championships .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball , &quot; soon and turns around statistics , and to use these to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the average performance of the battle .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a battle beats 300 .
that means that the player suggests three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s meaning the ball into the forestry , he comes up , he &apos;s not going to catch , and who has tried to throw the ball on the first base , it didn &apos;t do it in time , it didn &apos;
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300ter in major league baseball ?
well , really , maybe an all star .
do you know how to call a 400th ?
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s considering four of 10 .
legendary -- how ted william &apos;s legendary -- the last major league player who met over 400 times during a regular season .
let &apos;s transform back into medicine world where i feel a little bit better , or maybe a little bit less that i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
if you &apos;ve got a blind protection , and they &apos;re going to prove to an operator , that average performance is 400 in terms of blind preservations .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they &apos;re living in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved people with clusted heart suacesses , and their hossentially provides them to a cardiologist whose average performance
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the increasing ast .
and she &apos;s suggesting a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birth shelfer , should be a rescue ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicines knows what to be a good surgeon or doctor and rescue .
but what we do is that we &apos;re including each of them , including me to be perfectly in the world .
never make a mistake , but nobody &apos;s going to think about the details how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i recorded in medical school .
i was an obsessive student .
in the high school has told a student that brian goldman was going to learn for a blood test .
and that &apos;s what it was .
and i learned in my little radiation in the nurses residention at the toronto general hospital , unfortunate from here .
i learned everything .
in my antomy of my anatomy , i learned the origins and the outsides of every muscle , every branch of any artery that leads from the aorta , obscure and common differential diagnoses .
even knew the differential diagnosis to classify retal tubular acidoses .
and all the time , i collected more and more .
and i was good , i closed with course .
and i left the medical study with the impression that i knew if i knew everything , and everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to completely as possible that i was immunity as possi
and it worked for a time until i met woman printers .
i resigned a teacher hospital here in toronto as a woman as woman as a woman &apos;s department department .
at that point , i was the cardiological service in this point .
and it was my commission when the emergence of cardiological advice was looking for to study the emergency patients .
and give feedback to my doctor .
i studied woman printer , and she was in ate .
and when i listened to her , they made sounds .
and when i stopped her breast with the stethoscope , i could hear a broken sound on both sides , which told me that she &apos;s going under congestive heart failure .
that &apos;s a state where the heart fails , instead of pumping the entire blood further , and part of the blood continues in the lung , and it &apos;s filling this one , and that &apos;s why the sh
and that wasn &apos;t hard to put diagnosis .
i put them , and i did myself to the treatment .
i gave your aspiri . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water to pill water , so that it &apos;s going to get the liquid .
and over a period of one and a half to two hours , started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and then i did my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent her home without my doctor .
i didn &apos;t take the hearing , and i did what i should have , what would have been a call for him to deal with him , so that he had an opportunity to make your own picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to explain additional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the help doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take over the responsibility that i was like this , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
and by sending them home , i went to myself a small voice in me who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do that . &quot;
in fact , it was so much of self-security that i asked the nurse , which was caring about woman printers , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; clear , i think it &apos;s going to go good . &quot;
i remember it &apos;s been yesterday .
and so i signed the lessons papers and a disease and a distance , and they brought them home .
and i got back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this next feeling in my point .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i put my things , losing the hospital , and went to the parking to go home with the car , when i did something else i didn &apos;t .
i went home through the emergency department on my way .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the sister that had seen for woman printers , but another three words to me , and these three words fear the most emergency resources that i know .
other mediciners are afraid this , but the emergence medicine is very special because we &apos;re just seeing the patients .
the three words , remember ?
&quot; remember the patients you sent home ? &quot;
asked the nurse saddless .
&quot; so , she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular tone .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
and about an hour after her got at home after sending them home , and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistants took them back to the emergency pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock .
she &apos;d breathe , and she was blue .
the emergency personal moved all the strands .
they gave their blood printers .
they closed them to the breathing machine .
i was shocked and dropped into the internal .
and i was living through this railroad because she came to the intensive station and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , realized that she was never going to walk again .
she didn &apos;t have a treatment brain damage .
their family collected .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they made up with that .
on the day , they read them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they &apos;re saying that you never forget that the names of these that never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next weeks , i did myself , and i learned for the first time even the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt ilsolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend price , even though that one of these is going down , and you &apos;ll be able to get the best friend with it , and you &apos
if you &apos;re doing recurrence and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of teaching shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you in the inner sick .
it &apos;s the one who says that not what you &apos;ve done , but you &apos;re bad yourself .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my obercast , he was very love .
he was talking to the family and i &apos;m sure he slided the works and sure that i wasn &apos;t going to sell .
but i asked these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the doctor ? why did i send her home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i going to medicine ?
slowly , but surely put it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a polluted day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i might say , maybe i can feel better .
and i was that i was that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again a mistake , that the voice might go .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened .
two years later , i was services in a communal hospital north of toronto , and i actually considered a 25-year-old man with the current rights .
it was a lot of going on and i &apos;m in .
he always showed here .
i looked in the rights , and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and when he went out of the door , he showed on his rights .
two days later , i came up with my next emergency service and my cheristry asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the crazy ? &quot;
it turned out that he turns out he &apos;s a strengtock infection .
he had a potentially dangerous disease called epigottics .
you can google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the ridge , but it &apos;s the upper breakthrough , and causes the close of the response .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intraveusic antibiac , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , felt liberating , and went back to the work until it happened again and again and again .
i &apos;ve been looking at an emergency layer , two times a blind preservation .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially when you think you &apos;ve been working in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there weren &apos;t the lack of their treatment .
i thought he thought he would have kidney stones .
i was ordering the x-rays of the kidney . when that was without finished , my colleague in the bottom of the patient was considered a behavior in the lower right sector and called the operators .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i was ordering fluids to refrect him and asked my colleagues as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he realized a response in the right bottom sector , he called the operators .
in both cases , operated , and they were good .
both cases said to me , asked me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but totally nonsense .
some of my plople happened in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , shame and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t complete with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m voice to tell me what can &apos;t happen , how can i share with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that you don &apos;t move the same ?
if i went to a room -- as now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when the last time you &apos;ve been heard of somebody &apos;s failure of failure talking about failure ?
oh , you go to a cocktail party and there you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i went to a space full of colleagues and asked their immediate support to tell you what i just told you , i wouldn &apos;t reach the end of the second history before they really wouldn &apos;t do
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that an orthopedic in my hospital would have someone the wrong leg , then you think i would have looked at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a total denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- those who make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do , the ones that restrict with bad results and with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we make those who make mistakes make us from medicine that there &apos;s a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my mind about 20 years of medical show consciousness and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical trial about medical mistakes and wrong treatments , so that &apos;s all possible for on
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely impossible .
we &apos;re working in a system that happens every day in which one of these 10 medications are either a false or wrong , where hospital infections are always becoming more and more more more and mo
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of environmental mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine captures the number at 100,000 .
these are strong understatements , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system where the medical knowledge is doubling , every two to three years , we can &apos;t be able to stop .
sleeping is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake so that we can take a perfect disease for a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patient with breast pain , push it away and sustainable , and still give him an easy alcoholized breath , and suddenly the story is considered with contemplation .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not a car ; they don &apos;t always report their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are mistakes inevitable .
so when you take the system , as i was taught , and extracts all the fascinated health experts , then it &apos;s not more left at the end .
and you know the leaders about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; it &apos;s my worst mistake : &quot; i would say to everybody of the rescuences , &quot; i would say to everyb
and then their pupills expand , they &apos;re coming in front of your head , then look down and swallow , and start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistakes that i factered . &quot;
what they need is an environment that &apos;s being able to do .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it begins with a doctor .
the defined doctor is a human because it accepts his humanity , accepting it , is not proud of making mistakes , but puts everything from them to learn anything from them so that it can be passed on
it shares your experience with others .
it supports when others are talking about their mistakes .
and she shows others whose mistakes , not to make it , but in a loving , supportive species so that all of them benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people are filling the system with life , and if that &apos;s , then people are mistakes from time to time .
so that the system develops developing the mistakes that make it easier to feel mistakes that make people inevitable , and it &apos;s also enabled to create things like me that make healthcare , and
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m regret that , but i &apos;m trying to learn best possible to pass it others .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about changing norms .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know that he was here in 1832 .
you might think that he had finished , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fishes .
he described one of them as very , &quot; ordinary . &quot;
it was a broken .
until the &apos; 80s , he was fished in big style .
now he &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
this is a story that we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we &apos;re still going on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the brochures are still describing them .
what happened here ?
the second story should be a different concept , the change-ball of the change .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoon in west africa in 1971 .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i can integrate .
and i got a bad sun , and was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get from there .
it was my first sunband .
as you can see , the lagoons of palms and some mangroves .
there was a battle of about 20 centimeters , black brothers , an understanding of the funntary .
the fisherments of these bungards were very common , and the fishermers lived well from them , and the fishermen lived over average .
when i went back there in 27 years later , the fish has swamped on half of his size .
growing up five centimeters .
they were genetically pressed .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish had the lucky to be there .
so it didn &apos;t change anything , and yet , everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my middle change in the introduction of the flushing fishery in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , europe provided a lot of developmental projects .
fishing matters meant 100,000 fishes , the industrial fishing of this pretty ugly ship is called mutaiaa .
i went down to that , and we made uncestors all over the southern southern chinese sea , and especially in javase .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
now i know it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our beginning were swimm , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the streams , the trucks , were coral reef fish .
essentially , the sea came on deck and then thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within a year , you &apos;re going through an ancestry , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . from -- in this case -- a tough reason or soft corals , that &apos;s going to be more powerful .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , you threw them away , because they were dead .
once , we started a living .
she was not drowning .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat good .
in fact , this mountain will accumulate from struggles every time they drive in areas where they &apos;ve never been fished .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our norms of the new level and call us not memory what was there .
if you generalize it , that &apos;s what happens .
on the y-axis , some good things are : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of their country , the water supply .
over time , it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for people , they are , of course .
each generation looks at the images that they take them in the beginning of their conscious life , as standard , and it &apos;s going to get everything from it .
then the difference becomes as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be a sequence of change .
and at the end , they &apos;re just going to get the remaining remains .
that &apos;s exactly what our goal is now .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not like they were .
you could now think that the problem is people who certainly lived when they lived in predatory societies , and they were aware of a few generations what they did .
because obviously , an animal that gave it very often , first of all , before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose any often .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
over time , we &apos;re focusing on the great animals and in the ocean , these are the big fish .
they get rarer because we start them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left and we think that &apos;s the normal .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists are confirmed that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you prevent in a former form , they &apos;re not like you like to exist the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a captain &apos;s report can &apos;t be used , or from fishing scientists normally don &apos;t use it , because it &apos;s not scientific 
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t true the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous large role that can play a marine protected area .
because through sea protected areas , we basically provide the past .
we put the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the norms have changed and very low .
so the people who see a marine protected area and benefit from the insight that it allows you to return their norms .
what about the people who don &apos;t do that because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
here , i think , the art and the movie maybe filling the gap , and as simulations .
this is the chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray wheels -- 500 years ago .
and the colors and the scenes might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except from the pocahonestal history , why were they touched by the imagery ?
because it &apos;s something that was lost in some ways .
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give is coming out of cameron so that he turns &quot; avatari i &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist germany , you would have to register when you had a typewriter , they registered this in the government .
they also had to register a sheet from this writing machine .
the reason is that the government could track back where a text came back .
they found an article with wrong thoughts , they could find the creators of these thoughts .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how somebody could do something like this , and how much that would restrict the speech .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but when you &apos;re buying a new color base printer today in 2011 to the leading laser printers , and express a page , this side has light yellow spots on each page in a pattern that makes the pag
that &apos;s what happens today .
and there &apos;s no one that doesn &apos;t seem to express .
and this was an example of which our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing online problems today .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from kiep in the ukrain .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use online attacks to earn a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of online , multi-millionaires that made their money through attacks .
this is laddimis tastin &apos;s tarton from tartur in estand .
this is alfred gollzeze .
stephen watt .
born sundin sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tair al-dadour and so on and so forth .
these people have come online to wealth , but they acquired it illegal by using money from our banking to clean money from our banking , or also keygogrer , who have collected our credit information
american intelligence age two months ago , the swiss conton of mr. sam jain here , and on this conton , 1.4 million u.s. dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain self is on free foot , which is unknown .
and i &apos;m likely to argue that it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of online crime as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be more worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second largest attacks that we can observe today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , or protests , or through your audience .
and groups like anonymous stopped over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main attacks : criminals that do the money , doing hackivists like anonymous , who are resistant with it , but the last groups are nations , who lead the attacks .
that &apos;s where we are , like the diginotar .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
digitonary is a full-power certification out of the netherlands -- because it was .
in the last fall , it had to suggest insolence , because diginotar was hacked .
somebody &apos;s broken , and the system had been hacking .
and last week in a meeting with the dutch government governments , i asked one of the conditions of this group , whether he thought it was possible that because of the digitonar hack people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
well , how do people dying in consequences of these hacks ?
digitonary is a certification position .
they sell certifications .
what do you do with certifications ?
well , a certification you need , if you have a website with phts , with s-s encrypted services , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gimll or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly spreading in totalitarian states like iran , where dissident foreign offers can be
but can you , if you &apos;re in a foreign location .
certification desires hacking and faked certificates .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in the case of digiotator .
how does it behave with the arab spring and the things that happened for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the instructions in april 2011 were the main quarter of the egyptian secret police , and that &apos;s where they found a lot of acts .
in these acts , an order called &quot; finfish . &quot;
and in this order , notes one in germany were in germany that the egyptian government had sold some programs that they -- in very large communications -- any communication of the egyptian citizens c
they sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company &apos;s company is right here .
so western governments are totalitarian governments so that the against their own citizens can do .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , the so-called state stroams , this was a trojaner who was used by german government to set their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be suspected in a criminal fall , then your telephone is attacked with quite security .
but today we &apos;re far beyond .
they &apos;re taking their internet connection .
they use means like the state trojans to play their computers with a trojen , who allows them to monitor their own communications to listen to their online discussions to collect their passwords .
so if we continue to think about things like that , then the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t affect me because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we have today , in 2011 , we like trusting our governments , there &apos;s every right that we &apos;re going to do forever .
and we &apos;re trusting , we &apos;re trusting blind one future government , a government that we may have in about 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to engage in the next 50 years .
it may appear weird , but i &apos;m a great fan of concrete bolls .
the first competitions were produced in 1868 , and a simple idea : modules from cement with determined measures that fit together .
there &apos;s been really quickly the most used buildings in the world .
they put us to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
it was essentially the concretional building block has become the building block of our time .
almost hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it was called the automatically combined stone .
and within a few years , lego , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for each person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego was essentially the concrete , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the next revolution , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastic unity that would be able to get us from a world of the static , changed building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more complex cycles , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building of our time is reserved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
littlebes are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re prefounded , light , tone and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect together with magnets .
so they can &apos;t put them around .
the stones are colorful .
green is expansion , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is cable .
so everything you have to do is connect a blue and a green together , and they can build very quickly larger cycles .
they add a blue to a green , and you can do light .
you can put a switch in between , and so they created a little dime .
take the switch out around a pulse module , which is , and they made a little blinder .
add this buzzer for an extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a noise .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , littlebits are actually pretty powerful .
instead of programming , you have to wire or solves , literlibes allows you to program them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to speed or slow down or slow down , just turn in this button , and he &apos;s doing the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind literacy is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction around the world into a finished rock .
lights , solar elements , solar elements , engines -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve distributed litelites in children and see them play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start understanding the electronics that you start to understand and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a night thing works , or why the doors of the elevator respond , or respond like an ipod on touch .
we also brought littlebits to design schools .
so we didn &apos;t have designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with litebiles as a material .
here we see , with film , paper and water bottles , like geordi ..
a couple of weeks ago , we brought litelites to risd , and they gave some designers that had no technical experience -- just cartoon and wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; does what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a movemental conferent cannon .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a humber from the key , which has fear in the darkness .
for these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to do this material for all available .
so litelites is open source .
you can go to the website , download all the design prejections and make them ourselves .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor who encourages encouragements , because the world in which we live in , this interactive world , are belong .
so , pull them up and start inventing .
thank you .
